Carthage => [][][][][][][][][][][][][][]19 BC[](New York: Random House 1983), p. 18–19 (Book I, 421–424). Cf., Lancel, ''Carthage'' (1997) p. 38. Here capitalized as prose.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil here, however, does innocently inject his own Roman cultural notions into his imagined description, e.g., Punic Carthage evidently built no theaters ''per se''. Cf., Charles-Picard, ''Daily Life in Carthage'' (1958; 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two inner harbours [] were located in the southeast; one being commercial, and the other for war. Their definite functions are not entirely known, probably for the construction, outfitting, or repair of ships, perhaps also loading and unloading cargo.&lt;ref&gt;The harbours, often mentioned by ancient authors, remain an archaeological problem due to the limited, fragmented evidence found. Lancel, ''Carthage'' (1992; 1997) at 172–192 (the two harbours).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harden, ''The Phoenicians'' (1962, 2d ed. 1963) at 32, 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960, 1964) at 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger []ages existed to the north and south of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Sebkrit er Riana to the north, and [] to the south []. Harden, ''The Phoenicians'' (1962, 2d ed. 1963) at 31–32. Ships then could also be beached on the sand.&lt;/ref&gt; North and west of the ''cothon'' were located several industrial areas, e.g., metalworking and pottery (e.g., for []), which could serve both inner harbours, and ships anchored to the south of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Lancel, ''Carthage'' (1992; 1997) at 139–140, city map at 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

About the [], the [] area to the north,&lt;ref&gt;The lands immediately south of the hill is often also included by the term ''Byrsa''.&lt;/ref&gt; considering its importance our knowledge of it is patchy. Its prominent heights were the scene of fierce combat during the fiery destruction of the city in 146 BC. The Byrsa was the reported site of the Temple of [] (the healing god), at the top of a stairway of sixty steps.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel, ''Carthage. A history'' (Paris: Librairie Arthème Fayard 1992; Oxford: Blackwell 1995) at 148–152; 151 and 149 map (leveling operations on the Byrsa, circa 25 BC, to prepare for new construction), 426 (Temple of Eshmun), 443 (Byrsa diagram, circa 1859). The Byrsa had been destroyed during the [] (149–146).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Picard, ''Daily Life in Carthage'' (Paris 1958; London 1961, reprint Macmillan 1968) at 8 (city map showing the Temple of Eshmoun, on the eastern heights of the Byrsa).&lt;/ref&gt; A temple of [] (the city's queen goddess) was likely situated on the slope of the 'lesser Byrsa' immediately to the east, which runs down toward the sea.&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Bouchier, ''Life and Letters in Roman Africa'' (Oxford: B. H. Blackwell 1913) at 17, and 75. The Roman temple to [] is said to be later erected on the site of the ruined temple to [].&lt;/ref&gt; Also situated on the Byrsa were luxury homes.&lt;ref&gt;On the Byrsa some evidence remains of quality residential construction of 2nd century BC. Soren, Khader, Slim, ''Carthage'' (1990) at 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

South of the citadel, near the ''cothon'' (the inner harbours) was the ''[]'', a special and very old [], which when begun lay outside the city's boundaries. Here the ''Salammbô'' was located, the ''Sanctuary of Tanit'', not a temple but an enclosure for placing stone []. These were mostly short and upright, carved for funeral purposes. The presence of infant skeletons from here may indicate the occurrence of child sacrifice, as claimed in the Bible, although there is considerable doubt among archeologists as to this interpretation and many consider it simply a cemetery devoted to infants.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Schwartz, Frank Houghton, Roberto Macchiarelli, Luca Bondioli “Skeletal Remains from Punic Carthage Do Not Support Systematic Sacrifice of Infants” http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009177&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the ''tophet'' burial fields were &quot;dedicated at an early date, perhaps by the first settlers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Warmington, ''Carthage'' (London: Robert Hale 1960; reprint Penguin 1964) at 15 (quote), 25, 141; (London: Robert Hale, 2d ed. 1969) at 27 (quote), 131–132, 133 (enclosure).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the section on ''Punic religion'' below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the sea-filled ''cothon'' for shipping and the Byrsa heights lay the ''[]'' [], the city-state's central marketplace for business and commerce. The ''agora'' was also an area of public squares and plazas, where the people might formally assemble, or gather for festivals. It was the site of religious shrines, and the location of whatever were the major municipal buildings of Carthage. Here beat the heart of civic life. In this district of the Carthage, more probably, the ruling []s presided, the council of elders convened, the tribunal of the 104 met, and justice was dispensed at trials in the open air.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960, 1964) at 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Modern archeologists on the site have not yet 'discovered' the ancient ''agora''. Lancel, ''Carthage'' (Paris 1992; Oxford 1997) at 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early residential districts wrapped around the Byrsa from the south to the north east. Houses usually were []ed and blank to the street, but within were []s open to the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960, 1964) at 142.&lt;/ref&gt; In these neighborhoods multistory construction later became common, some up to six stories tall according to an ancient Greek author.&lt;ref&gt;[] of Alexandria (c.95 – c.160s), ''Pomaika'' known as the ''Roman History'', at VII (''Libyca''), 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harden, ''The Phoenicians'' (1962, 2d ed. 1963) at 133 &amp; 229n17 (Appian cited).&lt;/ref&gt; Several [] []s of homes have been revealed by recent [], as well as the general layout of several []. Stone stairs were set in the streets, and [] was planned, e.g., in the form of soakways leaching into the sandy soil.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, ''Carthage'' (Paris 1992; Oxford 1997) at 152–172, e.g., 163–165 (floorplans), 167–171 (neighborhood diagrams and photographs).&lt;/ref&gt; Along the Byrsa's southern slope were located not only fine old homes, but also many of the earliest grave-sites, juxtaposed in small areas, interspersed with daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Warmington, ''Carthage'' (1960, 1964) at 139 (map of city, re the tophet), 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

[] workshops were located in the city at sites north and west of the harbours. The location of three [] (implied from iron slag and other vestiges of such activity) were found adjacent to the naval and commercial harbours, and another two were further up the hill toward the Byrsa citadel. Sites of [] []s have been identified, between the ''agora'' and the harbours, and further north. Earthenware often used Greek models. A []'s shop for preparing woolen cloth (shrink and thicken) was evidently situated further to the west and south, then by the edge of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, ''Carthage'' (Paris 1992; Oxford 1997) at 138–140. These findings mostly relate to the 3rd century BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Carthage also produced objects of rare refinement. During the 4th and 3rd centuries, the [] of the [] became works of art. &quot;Bronze [] and stone-carving reached their zenith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Picard, ''The Life and Death of Carthage'' (Paris 1970; New York 1968) at 162–165 (carvings described), 176–178 (quote).&lt;/ref&gt;

The elevation of the land at the promontory on the seashore to the north-east (now called []), was twice as high above sea level as that at the Byrsa (100 m and 50 m). In between runs a ridge, several times reaching 50 m; it continues northwestward along the seashore, and forms the edge of a plateau-like area between the Byrsa and the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, ''Carthage'' (1992; 1997) at 138 and 145 (city maps).&lt;/ref&gt; Newer urban developments lay here in these northern districts.&lt;ref&gt;This was especially so, later in the Roman era. E.g., Soren, Khader, Slim, ''Carthage'' (1990) at 187–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrounding Carthage were [] &quot;of great strength&quot; said in places to rise above 13 m, being nearly 10 m thick, according to ancient authors. To the west, three parallel walls were built. The walls altogether ran for about {{convert
