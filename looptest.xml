The '''IRI T22B''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[helicopter]] that was designed and produced by [[Italian Rotors Industries]] of [[Aprilia, Lazio]]. Now out of production, when it was available the aircraft was supplied complete and ready-to-fly.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDLA15&quot;&gt;Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: ''World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16'', page 208. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. {{ISSN|1368-485X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company seems to have been founded about 2013 and gone out of business in June 2016, ending production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.irihelicopters.eu/|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|work=archive.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/irihelicopters|title = Italian Rotors Industries |accessdate = 30 December 2017|author=[[Italian Rotors Industries]] |work = [[Facebook]]|date = 28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
The T22B features a single main rotor and tail rotor, a two-seats-in [[side-by-side configuration]] enclosed cockpit with a windshield, [[skid landing gear]] and a four-cylinder, air-cooled, [[four stroke]] {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Lycoming O-320|Lycoming O-320-B2C]] [[aircraft engine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WDLA15&quot;/&gt;

The aircraft [[fuselage]] is made from composites. Its two-bladed rotor has a diameter of {{convert|7.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}. The aircraft has a typical empty weight of {{convert|355|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and a gross weight of {{convert|650|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, giving a useful load of {{convert|295|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. With full fuel of {{convert|70|l}}, the payload for the crew, passenger and baggage is {{convert|244|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDLA15&quot;/&gt;

In 2015, reviewer Werner Pfaendler described the T22B's design as &quot;elegant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDLA15&quot;/&gt;

'''''Helen Keller''''' is a [[bronze sculpture]] depicting the [[Helen Keller|American author and political activist of the same name]] by [[Edward Hlavka]], installed in the [[United States Capitol Visitor Center]]'s Emancipation Hall, in [[Washington, D.C.]], as part of the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]]. The statue was gifted by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]] in 2009, and replaced one depicting [[Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry]], which had been donated in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Helen Keller|url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/helen-keller|publisher=[[Architect of the Capitol]]|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and history==
On October 7, 2009, a bronze statue of Keller was added to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], as a replacement for the State of Alabama's former 1908 statue of the education reformer [[Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry]]. It is displayed in the [[United States Capitol Visitor Center]] and depicts Keller as a seven-year-old child standing at a [[Hand pump|water pump]]. The statue represents the seminal moment in Keller's life when she understood her first word: W-A-T-E-R, as signed into her hand by teacher Anne Sullivan. The pedestal base bears a quotation in raised Latin and braille letters: &quot;The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched, they must be felt with the heart.&quot;&lt;ref name=AOC/&gt;  The statue is the first one of a person with a disability and of a child to be permanently displayed at the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Helen Keller Statue Unveiled in Capitol |newspaper=[[CBS News]] |date=October 7, 2009 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/07/politics/main5369775.shtml |accessdate=December 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Helen Keller statue unveiled at Capitol |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=October 7, 2009 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/10/07/HELEN.KELLER.STATUE/index.html |accessdate=December 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One Impressive Kid Gets Her Statue at Capitol |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 8, 2009 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/07/AR2009100703498.html |accessdate=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronze]] is the most popular metal for [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] metal [[sculptures]]; a cast '''bronze sculpture''' is often called simply a "bronze".  It can be used for statues, singly or in groups, [[relief]]s, and small statuettes and [[figurine]]s, as well as bronze elements to be fitted to other objects such as furniture.  It is often [[gilding|gilded]] to give [[gilt-bronze]] or [[ormolu]].

Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Then, as the bronze cools, it shrinks a little, making it easier to separate from the mould.<ref>Savage, George, ‘’A Concise History of Bronzes’’, Frederick A. Praeger, Inc. Publishers,  New York,  1968 p. 17</ref> Their strength and ductility (lack of brittleness) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various [[ceramic]] or stone materials (such as [[marble sculpture]]). These qualities allow the creation of extended figures, as in ''Jeté'', or figures that have small cross sections in their support, such as the equestrian statue of ''Richard the Lionheart''.<ref name="Caleb Hornbostel 1991 p. 175">Caleb Hornbostel, ''Construction Materials: Types, Uses and Applications, Second Edition'' (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1991) p. 175.</ref>

But the value of the bronze for uses other than making statues is disadvantageous to the preservation of sculptures; few large ancient bronzes have survived, as many were melted down to make weapons or ammunition in times of war or to create new sculptures commemorating the victors, while far more stone and ceramic works have come through the centuries, even if only in fragments.  As recently as 2007 several life sized bronze sculptures by [[John Henry Waddell|John Waddell]] were stolen, probably due to the value of the metal after the work has been melted.<ref>http://www.evelinenow.com/BeautyandtheBeastinCornvilleArizona.html</ref>

==Material==
There are many different bronze alloys, and the term is now tending to be regarded by museums as too imprecise, and replaced in descriptions by "copper alloy", especially for older objects.  Typically modern bronze is 88% [[copper]] and 12% [[tin]].<ref>Knapp, Brian. (1996) ''Copper, Silver and Gold''. Reed Library, Australia.</ref> Alpha bronze consists of the alpha [[solid solution]] of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4–5% tin are used to make coins and a number of mechanical applications. Historical bronzes are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver – between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins.  The [[Benin Bronzes]] are really brass, and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]] is described as both bronze and brass.

In the Bronze Age, two forms of bronze were commonly used: "classic bronze", about 10% tin, was used in casting; and "mild bronze", about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were mostly cast from classic bronze, while helmets and armour were hammered from mild bronze.  According to one definition, modern "statuary bronze" is 90% copper and 10% tin.<ref name="Caleb Hornbostel 1991 p. 175"/>

== History ==
[[File:Queen Sembiyan Mahadevi as the Goddess Parvati (915582657).jpg|thumb|[[Chola bronze]] of Queen Sembiyan Mahadevi as the goddess [[Parvati]]]]
{{further information|History of sculpture}}
The great civilizations of the old world worked in bronze for art, from the time of the introduction of the alloy for tools and edged weapons. ''[[Dancing Girl (Mohenjo-daro)|Dancing Girl]]'' from Mohenjodaro belonging to the Harappan civilization dating back to 2500 BCE is perhaps the first bronze statue.<ref>http://www.nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/prodCollections.asp?pid=44&id=1&lk=dp1</ref> The Greeks were the first to scale the figures up to life size. Few examples exist in good condition; one is the seawater-preserved bronze ''[[Victorious Youth]]'' that required painstaking efforts to bring it to its present state for museum display. Far more Roman bronze statues have survived.

The ancient Chinese knew both [[lost-wax casting]] and section mould casting, and during the [[Shang dynasty]] created large numbers of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], ritual vessels covered with complex decoration, which were buried in sets of up to 200 pieces in the tombs of royalty and the nobility. Over the long creative period of Egyptian dynastic art, small lost-wax bronze figurines were made in large numbers; several thousand of them have been conserved in museum collections.

Sri Lankan [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] bronze statue of Buddhist Alakothiveshwara [http://Tara%20Devi Tara Devi] statue, now in England, is an excellent example of Bronze statues.
From the ninth through the thirteenth century the [[Chola dynasty]] in South India represented the pinnacle of bronze casting in India.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chola Bronzes. Asiatic Society |author= |url=http://sites.asiasociety.org/chola/ |publisher=Asia Society |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231050655/http://sites.asiasociety.org/chola/ |archivedate=2009-12-31 |df= }}</ref>

== Process ==

Making bronzes is highly skilled work, and a number of distinct casting processes may be employed, including [[Lost-wax casting#Process|lost-wax casting]] (and its modern-day spin-off [[investment casting]]), [[sand casting]] and [[centrifugal casting (silversmithing)|centrifugal casting]]. The term "bronze" is also applied to metal sculptures made by [[electrotyping]] (or galvanoplasty), although these sculptures are typically pure copper and their fabrication does not involve metal casting.<ref name=Scott>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=David A. |title=Copper and bronze in art: corrosion, colourants, conservation |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-89236-638-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQKuSOzkLvcC&pg=PA26 |quote=Some extremely important commissions were made in electrotypes, such as the "bronzes" that adorn the Opera, Paris, and the 320 cm high statue of Prince Albert and four accompanying figures, erected behind the Albert Hall in London as a memorial to the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Prince Albert statue was electrotyped by Elkington & Company of Birmingham, England, in 1861 and has recently been restored.}} Note that the Memorial to the Great Exhibition was originally erected in the garden of the Royal Horticultural Society, and moved to its present location around 1890.</ref>

=== Lost wax method ===
{{main article|Lost wax casting}}

In lost-wax or investment casting, the artist starts with a full-sized model of the sculpture, most often a non-drying oil-based clay such as [[Plasticine]] model for smaller sculptures or for sculptures to be developed over an extended period (water-based clays must be protected from drying), and water-based clay for larger sculptures or for sculptures for which it is desired to capture a ''gestural'' quality - one that transmits the motion of the sculptor in addition to that of the subject. A mould is made from the clay pattern, either as a piece mould from plaster, or using flexible gel or similar rubber-like materials stabilized by a plaster jacket of several pieces. Often a [[plaster]] master will be made from this mould for further refinement. Such a plaster is a means of preserving the artwork until a patron may be found to finance a bronze casting, either from the original moulds or from a new mould made from the refined plaster positive.

Once a production mould is obtained, a wax (hollow for larger sculptures) is then cast from the mould. For a hollow sculpture, a [[core (manufacturing)|core]] is then cast into the void, and is retained in its proper location (after wax melting) by pins of the same metal used for casting. One or more wax [[sprue (manufacturing)|sprue]]s are added to conduct the molten metal into the sculptures - typically directing the liquid metal from a pouring cup to the bottom of the sculpture, which is then filled from the bottom up in order to avoid splashing and turbulence. Additional sprues may be directed upward at intermediate positions, and various vents may also be added where gases could be trapped. (Vents are not needed for ceramic shell casting, allowing the sprue to be simple and direct). The complete wax structure (and core, if previously added) is then invested in another kind of mould or shell, which is heated in a kiln until the wax runs out and all free moisture is removed. The investment is then soon filled with molten bronze. The removal of all wax and moisture prevents the liquid metal from being explosively ejected from the mould by steam and vapour.

Students of bronze casting will usually work in direct wax, where the model is made in wax, possibly formed over a core, or with a core cast in place, if the piece is to be hollow. If no mould is made and the casting process fails, the artwork will also be lost. After the metal has cooled, the external ceramic or clay is chipped away, revealing an image of the wax form, including core pins, sprues, vents, and risers. All of these are removed with a saw and tool marks are polished away, and interior core material is removed to reduce the likelihood of interior corrosion. Incomplete voids created by gas pockets or investment inclusions are then corrected by welding and carving. Small defects where sprues and vents were attached are filed or ground down and polished.

=== Creating large sculptures ===
[[File:Farcot and Carrier-Belleuse Conical Mystery Clock.jpg|thumb|200px|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eugène Farcot]] with a patinated bronze statue.]]
For a large sculpture, the artist will usually prepare small study models until the pose and proportions are determined. An intermediate-sized model is then constructed with all of the final details. For very large works, this may again be scaled to a larger intermediate. From the final scale model, measuring devices are used to determine the dimensions of an armature for the structural support of a full-size temporary piece, which is brought to rough form by wood, cardboard, plastic foam, and/or paper to approximately fill the volume while keeping the weight low. Finally, plaster, clay or other material is used to form the full-size model, from which a mould may be constructed. Alternatively, a large refactory core may be constructed, and the direct-wax method then applied for subsequent investment. Before modern welding techniques, large sculptures were generally cast in one piece with a single pour. Welding allows a large sculpture to be cast in pieces, then joined.

=== Finishing ===

After final polishing, corrosive materials may be applied to form a [[patina]], a process that allows some control over the colour and finish.

Another form of sculptural art that uses bronze is [[ormolu]], a finely cast soft bronze that is gilded (coated with gold) to produce a matte gold finish. Ormolu was popularized in the 18th century in France and is found in such forms as wall sconces (wall-mounted candle holders), inkstands, clocks and [[garniture]]s. Ormolu wares can be identified by a clear ring when tapped, showing that they are made of bronze, not a cheaper alloy such as [[spelter]] or [[pewter]].

[[Bronze]] is the most popular metal for [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] metal [[sculptures]]; a cast '''bronze sculpture''' is often called simply a "bronze".  It can be used for statues, singly or in groups, [[relief]]s, and small statuettes and [[figurine]]s, as well as bronze elements to be fitted to other objects such as furniture.  It is often [[gilding|gilded]] to give [[gilt-bronze]] or [[ormolu]].

Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Then, as the bronze cools, it shrinks a little, making it easier to separate from the mould.<ref>Savage, George, ‘’A Concise History of Bronzes’’, Frederick A. Praeger, Inc. Publishers,  New York,  1968 p. 17</ref> Their strength and ductility (lack of brittleness) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various [[ceramic]] or stone materials (such as [[marble sculpture]]). These qualities allow the creation of extended figures, as in ''Jeté'', or figures that have small cross sections in their support, such as the equestrian statue of ''Richard the Lionheart''.<ref name="Caleb Hornbostel 1991 p. 175">Caleb Hornbostel, ''Construction Materials: Types, Uses and Applications, Second Edition'' (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1991) p. 175.</ref>

But the value of the bronze for uses other than making statues is disadvantageous to the preservation of sculptures; few large ancient bronzes have survived, as many were melted down to make weapons or ammunition in times of war or to create new sculptures commemorating the victors, while far more stone and ceramic works have come through the centuries, even if only in fragments.  As recently as 2007 several life sized bronze sculptures by [[John Henry Waddell|John Waddell]] were stolen, probably due to the value of the metal after the work has been melted.<ref>http://www.evelinenow.com/BeautyandtheBeastinCornvilleArizona.html</ref>

==Material==
There are many different bronze alloys, and the term is now tending to be regarded by museums as too imprecise, and replaced in descriptions by "copper alloy", especially for older objects.  Typically modern bronze is 88% [[copper]] and 12% [[tin]].<ref>Knapp, Brian. (1996) ''Copper, Silver and Gold''. Reed Library, Australia.</ref> Alpha bronze consists of the alpha [[solid solution]] of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4–5% tin are used to make coins and a number of mechanical applications. Historical bronzes are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver – between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins.  The [[Benin Bronzes]] are really brass, and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]] is described as both bronze and brass.

In the Bronze Age, two forms of bronze were commonly used: "classic bronze", about 10% tin, was used in casting; and "mild bronze", about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were mostly cast from classic bronze, while helmets and armour were hammered from mild bronze.  According to one definition, modern "statuary bronze" is 90% copper and 10% tin.<ref name="Caleb Hornbostel 1991 p. 175"/>

{{further information|History of sculpture}}
The great civilizations of the old world worked in bronze for art, from the time of the introduction of the alloy for tools and edged weapons. ''[[Dancing Girl (Mohenjo-daro)|Dancing Girl]]'' from Mohenjodaro belonging to the Harappan civilization dating back to 2500 BCE is perhaps the first bronze statue.<ref>http://www.nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/prodCollections.asp?pid=44&id=1&lk=dp1</ref> The Greeks were the first to scale the figures up to life size. Few examples exist in good condition; one is the seawater-preserved bronze ''[[Victorious Youth]]'' that required painstaking efforts to bring it to its present state for museum display. Far more Roman bronze statues have survived.

The ancient Chinese knew both [[lost-wax casting]] and section mould casting, and during the [[Shang dynasty]] created large numbers of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], ritual vessels covered with complex decoration, which were buried in sets of up to 200 pieces in the tombs of royalty and the nobility. Over the long creative period of Egyptian dynastic art, small lost-wax bronze figurines were made in large numbers; several thousand of them have been conserved in museum collections.

Sri Lankan [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] bronze statue of Buddhist Alakothiveshwara [http://Tara%20Devi Tara Devi] statue, now in England, is an excellent example of Bronze statues.
From the ninth through the thirteenth century the [[Chola dynasty]] in South India represented the pinnacle of bronze casting in India.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chola Bronzes. Asiatic Society |author= |url=http://sites.asiasociety.org/chola/ |publisher=Asia Society |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231050655/http://sites.asiasociety.org/chola/ |archivedate=2009-12-31 |df= }}</ref>

== Process ==

Making bronzes is highly skilled work, and a number of distinct casting processes may be employed, including [[Lost-wax casting#Process|lost-wax casting]] (and its modern-day spin-off [[investment casting]]), [[sand casting]] and [[centrifugal casting (silversmithing)|centrifugal casting]]. The term "bronze" is also applied to metal sculptures made by [[electrotyping]] (or galvanoplasty), although these sculptures are typically pure copper and their fabrication does not involve metal casting.<ref name=Scott>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=David A. |title=Copper and bronze in art: corrosion, colourants, conservation |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-89236-638-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQKuSOzkLvcC&pg=PA26 |quote=Some extremely important commissions were made in electrotypes, such as the "bronzes" that adorn the Opera, Paris, and the 320 cm high statue of Prince Albert and four accompanying figures, erected behind the Albert Hall in London as a memorial to the Great Exhibition of 1851.

=== Lost wax method ===
{{main article|Lost wax casting}}

In lost-wax or investment casting, the artist starts with a full-sized model of the sculpture, most often a non-drying oil-based clay such as [[Plasticine]] model for smaller sculptures or for sculptures to be developed over an extended period (water-based clays must be protected from drying), and water-based clay for larger sculptures or for sculptures for which it is desired to capture a ''gestural'' quality - one that transmits the motion of the sculptor in addition to that of the subject. A mould is made from the clay pattern, either as a piece mould from plaster, or using flexible gel or similar rubber-like materials stabilized by a plaster jacket of several pieces. Often a [[plaster]] master will be made from this mould for further refinement. Such a plaster is a means of preserving the artwork until a patron may be found to finance a bronze casting, either from the original moulds or from a new mould made from the refined plaster positive.

Once a production mould is obtained, a wax (hollow for larger sculptures) is then cast from the mould. For a hollow sculpture, a [[core (manufacturing)|core]] is then cast into the void, and is retained in its proper location (after wax melting) by pins of the same metal used for casting. One or more wax [[sprue (manufacturing)|sprue]]s are added to conduct the molten metal into the sculptures - typically directing the liquid metal from a pouring cup to the bottom of the sculpture, which is then filled from the bottom up in order to avoid splashing and turbulence. Additional sprues may be directed upward at intermediate positions, and various vents may also be added where gases could be trapped. (Vents are not needed for ceramic shell casting, allowing the sprue to be simple and direct). The complete wax structure (and core, if previously added) is then invested in another kind of mould or shell, which is heated in a kiln until the wax runs out and all free moisture is removed. The investment is then soon filled with molten bronze. The removal of all wax and moisture prevents the liquid metal from being explosively ejected from the mould by steam and vapour.

Students of bronze casting will usually work in direct wax, where the model is made in wax, possibly formed over a core, or with a core cast in place, if the piece is to be hollow. If no mould is made and the casting process fails, the artwork will also be lost. After the metal has cooled, the external ceramic or clay is chipped away, revealing an image of the wax form, including core pins, sprues, vents, and risers. All of these are removed with a saw and tool marks are polished away, and interior core material is removed to reduce the likelihood of interior corrosion. Incomplete voids created by gas pockets or investment inclusions are then corrected by welding and carving. Small defects where sprues and vents were attached are filed or ground down and polished.

=== Creating large sculptures ===
[[File:Farcot and Carrier-Belleuse Conical Mystery Clock.jpg|thumb|200px|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eugène Farcot]] with a patinated bronze statue.]]
For a large sculpture, the artist will usually prepare small study models until the pose and proportions are determined. An intermediate-sized model is then constructed with all of the final details. For very large works, this may again be scaled to a larger intermediate. From the final scale model, measuring devices are used to determine the dimensions of an armature for the structural support of a full-size temporary piece, which is brought to rough form by wood, cardboard, plastic foam, and/or paper to approximately fill the volume while keeping the weight low. Finally, plaster, clay or other material is used to form the full-size model, from which a mould may be constructed. Alternatively, a large refactory core may be constructed, and the direct-wax method then applied for subsequent investment. Before modern welding techniques, large sculptures were generally cast in one piece with a single pour. Welding allows a large sculpture to be cast in pieces, then joined.

=== Finishing ===

After final polishing, corrosive materials may be applied to form a [[patina]], a process that allows some control over the colour and finish.

Another form of sculptural art that uses bronze is [[ormolu]], a finely cast soft bronze that is gilded (coated with gold) to produce a matte gold finish. Ormolu was popularized in the 18th century in France and is found in such forms as wall sconces (wall-mounted candle holders), inkstands, clocks and [[garniture]]s. Ormolu wares can be identified by a clear ring when tapped, showing that they are made of bronze, not a cheaper alloy such as [[spelter]] or [[pewter]].

[[File:Wooduv kov.jpg|thumb|[[Wood's metal]], a [[eutectic]], low melting point alloy of [[bismuth]], [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[cadmium]]]]

An '''alloy''' is a mixture of [[metal]]s or a mixture of a metal and another [[Chemical element|element]]. Alloys are defined by a metallic bonding character.<ref>Callister, W. D. "Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction" 2007, 7th edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York, Section 4.3 and Chapter 9.</ref> An alloy may be a [[solid solution]] of metal elements (a single phase) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions). [[Intermetallic]] compounds are alloys with a defined [[stoichiometry]] and crystal structure. [[Zintl phase]]s are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types (see also: [[Van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle]] for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds).

Alloys are used in a wide variety of applications. In some cases, a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. In other cases, the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength. Examples of alloys are [[steel]], [[solder]], [[brass]], [[pewter]], [[duralumin]], [[bronze]] and [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]s.

The alloy constituents are usually measured by mass percentage for practical applications, and in [[Atomic ratio|atomic fraction]] for basic science studies. Alloys are usually classified as substitutional or [[interstitial alloy]]s, depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. They can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or [[intermetallic]].

==Introduction==
[[File:Born bronze - Bronze casts.jpg|thumb|Liquid [[bronze]], being poured into molds during casting.]]
[[File:A brass light.JPG|thumb|A [[brass]] lamp.]]

An alloy is a mixture of [[chemical element]]s, which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a [[metal]]. An alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that, with an alloy, the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties, while impure metals such as [[wrought iron]] are less controlled, but are often considered useful. Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. This is usually called the primary metal or the base metal, and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy. The other constituents may or may not be metals but, when mixed with the molten base, they will be [[solubility|soluble]] and dissolve into the mixture.
The mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft ([[malleability|malleable]]), such as [[aluminium]], can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, such as [[copper]]. Although both metals are very soft and [[ductility|ductile]], the resulting [[aluminium alloy]] will have much greater [[strength of materials|strength]]. Adding a small amount of non-metallic [[carbon]] to [[iron]] trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called [[steel]]. Due to its very-high strength, but still substantial [[toughness]], and its ability to be greatly altered by [[heat treatment]], steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use. By adding [[chromium]] to steel, its resistance to [[corrosion]] can be enhanced, creating [[stainless steel]], while adding [[silicon]] will alter its electrical characteristics, producing [[silicon steel]].

Although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the [[liquid]] state, they may not always be soluble in the [[solid]] state. If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a [[solid solution]], becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a [[phase (matter)|phase]]. If as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous [[microstructure]] of different phases, some with more of one constituent than the other phase has. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. If cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] with the secondary constituents. As time passes, the atoms of these supersaturated alloys can separate from the crystal lattice, becoming more stable, and form a second phase that serve to reinforce the crystals internally.
Some alloys, such as [[electrum]] which is an alloy consisting of [[silver]] and [[gold]], occur naturally. Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and [[nickel]], but are not native to the Earth. One of the first alloys made by humans was [[bronze]], which is a mixture of the metals [[tin]] and [[copper]]. Bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients, because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components. Steel was another common alloy. However, in ancient times, it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires ([[smelting]]) during the manufacture of iron. Other ancient alloys include [[pewter]], [[brass]] and [[pig iron]]. In the modern age, steel can be created in many forms. [[Carbon steel]] can be made by varying only the carbon content, producing soft alloys like [[mild steel]] or hard alloys like [[spring steel]]. [[Alloy steel]]s can be made by adding other elements, such as [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[vanadium]] or [[nickel]], resulting in alloys such as [[high-speed steel]] or [[tool steel]]. Small amounts of [[manganese]] are usually alloyed with most modern steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities, like [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]], which can have detrimental effects on the alloy. However, most alloys were not created until the 1900s, such as various aluminium, [[titanium alloy|titanium]], [[nickel alloys|nickel]], and [[magnesium alloy]]s. Some modern [[superalloy]]s, such as [[incoloy]], [[inconel]], and [[hastelloy]], may consist of a multitude of different elements.

==Terminology==
[[File:Inconel gate valve--The-Alloy-Valve-Stockist.JPG|thumb|A gate valve, made from [[Inconel]].]]

As a noun, the term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. When used as a verb, the term refers to the act of mixing a metal with other elements. The primary metal is called the ''base'', the ''matrix'', or the ''[[solvent]]''. The secondary constituents are often called ''solutes''. If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms (not counting impurities) such as a [[copper-nickel]] alloy, then it is called a ''binary alloy.'' If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ''ternary alloy.'' An alloy with four constituents is a ''quaternary alloy,'' while a five-part alloy is termed a ''quinary alloy.'' Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a ''system''. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a ''binary system,'' while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ''ternary system''.<ref>Bauccio, Michael (1003) ''ASM metals reference book''. ASM International. {{ISBN|0-87170-478-1}}.</ref>

Although an alloy is technically an impure metal, when referring to alloys, the term "impurities" usually denotes those elements which are not desired. Such impurities are introduced from the base metals and alloying elements, but are removed during processing. For instance, sulfur is a common impurity in steel. Sulfur combines readily with iron to form [[iron sulfide]], which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Verhoeven, John D.|title=Steel Metallurgy for the Non-metallurgist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-1-61503-056-9|page=56|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505065853/https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56|archivedate=2016-05-05|df=}}</ref> [[Lithium]], [[sodium]] and [[calcium]] are common impurities in aluminium alloys, which can have adverse effects on the [[structural integrity]] of castings. Conversely, otherwise pure-metals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called "impure metals" and are not usually referred to as alloys. Oxygen, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form [[metal oxide]]s; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities, using [[flux (metallurgy)|fluxes]], chemical additives, or other methods of [[extractive metallurgy]].<ref>Davis, Joseph R. (1993) ''ASM Specialty Handbook: Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys''. ASM International. p. 211. {{ISBN|978-0-87170-496-2}}.</ref>

In practice, some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy. For example, 14 [[Karat (purity)|karat]] [[gold]] is an alloy of gold with other elements. Similarly, the [[silver]] used in [[jewelry]] and the [[aluminium]] used as a structural building material are also alloys.

The term "alloy" is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an [[aluminium alloy]] are commonly referred to as simply "[[alloy wheel]]s", although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys. Steel is such a common alloy that many items made from it, like [[wheel]]s, [[barrel]]s, or [[girder]]s, are simply referred to by the name of the item, assuming it is made of steel. When made from other materials, they are typically specified as such, (i.e.: "bronze wheel", "plastic barrel", or "wood girder").

==Theory==
Alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other elements that often enhance its properties. For example, the combination of carbon with iron produces [[steel]], which is stronger than [[iron]], its primary element. The [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as [[density]], [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], [[Young's modulus]] of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element, but engineering properties such as [[tensile strength]],<ref>Mills, Adelbert Phillo (1922) ''Materials of Construction: Their Manufacture and Properties'', John Wiley & sons, inc, originally published by the University of Wisconsin, Madison</ref> ductility, and [[shear strength]] may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the [[atom]]s in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=C.|title=Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|journal=Physical Review|volume=188|issue=2|pages=870|year=1969|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|bibcode=1969PhRv..188..870H}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=X.|last2=Suhl|first2=H.|title=Spin-wave-related period doublings and chaos under transverse pumping|journal=Physical Review A|volume=32|pages=2530–2533|year=1985|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.32.2530|pmid=9896377|issue=4|bibcode=1985PhRvA..32.2530Z}}</ref>
Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. [[Bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and [[tin]], was the first alloy discovered, during the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] period now known as the [[Bronze Age]]. It was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for [[ornament (architecture)|ornaments]], [[bell]]s, [[statue]]s, and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. [[Brass]] is an alloy made from [[copper]] and [[zinc]].

Unlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single [[melting point]], but a melting range during which the material is a mixture of [[solid]] and [[liquid]] phases (a slush). The temperature at which melting begins is called the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]], and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the [[liquidus]]. For many alloys there is a particular alloy proportion (in some cases more than one), called either a [[eutectic]] mixture or a peritectic composition, which gives the alloy a unique and low melting point, and no liquid/solid slush transition.

==Heat-treatable alloys==

[[File:Photomicrograph of annealed and quenched steel, from 1911 Britannica plates 11 and 14.jpg|thumb|Photomicrographs of [[steel]]. Top photo: [[annealing (metallurgy)|Annealed]] (slowly cooled) steel forms a heterogeneous, lamellar microstructure called [[pearlite]], consisting of the phases [[cementite]] (light) and [[Ferrite (iron)|ferrite]] (dark). Bottom photo: [[Quenched]] (quickly cooled) steel forms a single phase called [[martensite]], in which the carbon remains trapped within the crystals, creating internal stresses.]]

Alloying elements are added to a base metal, to induce [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[ductility]], or other desired properties. Most metals and alloys can be [[work hardening|work hardened]] by creating defects in their crystal structure. These defects are created during [[plastic deformation]] by hammering, bending, extruding, etcetera, and are permanent unless the metal is [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallized]]. Otherwise, some alloys can also have their properties altered by [[heat treatment]]. Nearly all metals can be softened by [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], and [[nickel]] can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree as does [[steel]].<ref name="Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14"/>

The base metal iron of the iron-carbon alloy known as steel, undergoes a change in the arrangement ([[allotropy]]) of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature (usually between {{convert|1500|F|C}} and {{convert|1600|F|C}}, depending on carbon content). This allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal. When this [[diffusion]] happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in ''[[solid solution|solution]]'' in the iron, forming a particular single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called [[austenite]]. If the steel is cooled slowly, the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope. During slow cooling, the carbon atoms will no longer be as [[solubility|soluble]] with the iron, and will be forced to [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, [[nucleating]] into a more concentrated form of iron carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C) in the spaces between the pure iron crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, as it is formed of two phases, the iron-carbon phase called [[cementite]] (or [[carbide]]), and pure iron [[ferrite (iron)|ferrite]]. Such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft. If the steel is cooled quickly, however, the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide, but will be trapped within the iron crystals. When rapidly cooled, a [[diffusionless transformation|diffusionless (martensite) transformation]] occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile (more brittle).

While the high strength of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented (forming martinsite), most heat-treatable alloys are [[precipitation hardening]] alloys, that depend on the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength. When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, but then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming [[intermetallic]] phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates into different crystal phases (carbide and ferrite), precipitation hardening alloys form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneously, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.<ref name="Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14"/>

==Substitutional and interstitial alloys==
[[File:Alloy atomic arrangements showing the different types.jpg|thumb|Different atomic mechanisms of alloy formation, showing pure metal, substitutional, interstitial, and a combination of the two.]]
When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called ''atom exchange'' and the ''interstitial mechanism''. The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a ''substitutional alloy''. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms respectively. In the case of the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other and  can not successfully substitute for the other type of atom in the crystals of the base metal. Instead, the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms of the crystal matrix, called the ''interstices''. This is referred to as an ''interstitial alloy''. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. [[Stainless steel]] is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are substituted by nickel and chromium atoms.<ref name="Jon L.

==History and examples==

===Meteoric iron===
[[File:Meteorite and a meteoritic iron hatchet.JPG|thumb|A [[meteorite]] and a hatchet that was forged from [[meteoric iron]].]]

The use of alloys by humans started with the use of [[meteoric iron]], a naturally occurring alloy of [[nickel]] and [[iron]]. It is the main constituent of [[iron meteorite]]s which occasionally fall down on Earth from outer space. As no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel, the alloy was used as it was.<ref>{{cite journal

===Bronze and brass===
[[File:Bronzebeile.JPG|right|thumb| [[Bronze]] axe 1100&nbsp;BC]]
[[File:Türzieher Bremen 1405.JPG|thumb|[[Bronze]] doorknocker]]
Iron is usually found as [[iron ore]] on Earth, except for one deposit of [[native iron]] in [[Greenland]], which was used by the [[Inuit]] people.<ref>[[#Buchwald|Buchwald]], pp. 35–37</ref> Native [[copper]], however, was found worldwide, along with [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[platinum]], which were also used to make tools, jewelry, and other objects since Neolithic times. Copper was the hardest of these metals, and the most widely distributed. It became one of the most important metals to the ancients. Eventually, humans learned to [[smelting|smelt]] metals such as copper, and [[tin]] from [[ore]], and, around 2500 BC, began alloying the two metals to form [[bronze]], which was much harder than its ingredients. Tin was rare, however, being found mostly in Great Britain. In the Middle East, people began alloying copper with [[zinc]] to form [[brass]].<ref>[[#Buchwald|Buchwald]], pp. 39–41</ref> Ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced, such as [[hardness]], [[toughness]] and [[melting point]], under various conditions of [[temperature]] and [[work hardening]], developing much of the information contained in modern [[Phase diagram|alloy phase diagram]]s.<ref name=r1/> Arrowheads from the Chinese [[Qin dynasty]] (around 200 BC) were often constructed with a hard bronze-head, but a softer bronze-tang, combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/emperors-ghost-army.html Emperor's Ghost Army] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101065925/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/emperors-ghost-army.html |date=2017-11-01 }}. pbs.org.

===Amalgams===
[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] has been smelted from [[cinnabar]] for thousands of years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]s (an alloy in a soft paste or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for [[gilding]] objects such as [[armor]] and [[mirror]]s with precious metals. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind.<ref>Rapp, George (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ed0yC98aAKYC&pg=PA180 ''Archaeomineralogy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005752/https://books.google.com/books?id=ed0yC98aAKYC&pg=PA180 |date=2016-04-28 }}.

===Precious-metal alloys===
[[File:25 litrai en électrum représentant un trépied delphien.jpg|thumb|[[Electrum]], a natural alloy of silver and gold, was often used for making coins.]]

Many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes. In ancient [[Egypt]] and [[Mycenae]], gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of [[colored gold]]. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Copper was often added to silver to make [[sterling silver]], increasing its strength for use in dishes, silverware, and other practical items. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers.<ref>Nicholson, Paul T. and Shaw, Ian (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj7A9jJrZP0C&pg=PA164 ''Ancient Egyptian materials and technology''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502125054/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj7A9jJrZP0C&pg=PA164 |date=2016-05-02 }}.

===Pewter===
The term [[pewter]] covers a variety of alloys consisting primarily of tin. As a pure metal, tin is much too soft to be used for any practical purpose. However, during the [[Bronze Age]], tin was a rare metal in many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean, due to this it was often valued higher than gold. To make jewellery, cutlery, or other objects from tin, it was usually alloyed with other metals to increase its strength and hardness. These metals were typically [[lead]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]] or copper. These solutes were sometimes added individually in varying amounts, or added together, making a wide variety of objects, ranging from practical items such as dishes, surgical tools, candlesticks or funnels, to decorative items like ear rings and hair clips.

The earliest examples of pewter come from ancient Egypt, around 1450 BC. The use of pewter was widespread across Europe, from France to Norway and Britain (where most of the ancient tin was mined) to the Near East.<ref>Hull, Charles (1992) ''Pewter''. Shire Publications. pp. 3–4; {{ISBN|0-7478-0152-5}}</ref> The alloy was also used in China and the Far East, arriving in Japan around 800 AD, where it was used for making objects like ceremonial vessels, tea canisters, or chalices used in [[shinto]] shrines.<ref>Brinkley, Frank (1904) ''Japan and China: Japan, its history, arts, and literature''. Oxford University. p. 317</ref>

===Steel and pig iron===
The first known smelting of iron began in [[Anatolia]], around 1800 BC. Called the [[bloomery|bloomery process]], it produced very soft but [[ductile]] [[wrought iron]]. By 800 BC, iron-making technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. [[Pig iron]], a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and [[carbon]], was being produced in [[History of China#Shang Dynasty (c. 1700–1046 BC)|China]] as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making [[cast-iron]]. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of [[crucible steel]] around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of [[pattern welding]], around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove [[slag]] and impurities. This method of [[Japanese swordsmithing]] produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the early Middle Ages.<ref name=r1>Smith, Cyril (1960) ''History of metallography''. MIT Press. pp. 2–4. {{ISBN|0-262-69120-5}}.</ref>

While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal was much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of [[steel]], (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by [[heat treatment]] had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of [[blister steel]] during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, [[Benjamin Huntsman]] began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of [[tool steel]]. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.<ref name="George Adam Roberts Page 2-3">Roberts, George Adam; Krauss, George; Kennedy, Richard and Kennedy, Richard L. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ScphevR_eP8C&pg=PA2 ''Tool steels''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424215509/https://books.google.com/books?id=ScphevR_eP8C&pg=PA2 |date=2016-04-24 }}. ASM International. pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|0-87170-599-0}}.</ref>

With the introduction of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, [[pig iron]] was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the [[liquid]] pig iron to create steel. [[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by [[oxidation]]. In 1858, [[Sir Henry Bessemer]] developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The [[Bessemer process]] was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel.<ref name="George Adam Roberts Page 2-3"/>

====Alloy steels====
Although steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, the term "[[alloy steel]]" usually only refers to those steels which contain other elements like [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], or [[cobalt]] in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel. Since ancient times when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons, the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets. Even long after the [[Age of reason]], the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went though great lengths to keep their processes confidential, resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods. For example, the people of [[Sheffield]], a center of steel production in England, were known to routinely bar visitors and tourists from entering town to deter [[industrial espionage]]. Thus, almost no metallurgical information existed about steel until 1860. Because of this lack of understanding, steel was not generally considered an alloy until the decades between 1930 and 1970 (primarily due to the work of scientists like [[William Chandler Roberts-Austen]], Adolph Martens, and [[Edgar Bain]]), so "alloy steel" became the popular term for ternary and quaternary steel-alloys.<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale – Cambridge University Press 1987 Page 57—62</ref><ref>''Experimental Techniques in Materials and Mechanics'' By C. Suryanarayana – CRC Press 2011 Page 202</ref>

After Benjamin Huntsman developed his [[crucible steel]] in 1740, he began experimenting with the addition of elements like [[manganese]] (in the form of a high-manganese pig-iron called ''[[spiegeleisen]]''), which helped remove impurities such a phosphorus and oxygen; a process adopted by Bessemer and still used in modern steels (albeit in concentrations low enough to still be considered carbon steel).<ref>''Tool Steels, 5th Edition'' By George Adam Roberts, Richard Kennedy, G. Krauss – ASM International 1998 Page 4</ref> Afterward, many people began experimenting with various alloys of steel without much success. However, in 1882, [[Robert Hadfield]], being a pioneer in steel metallurgy, took an interest and produced a steel alloy containing around 12% manganese. Called [[mangalloy]], it exhibited extreme hardness and toughness, becoming the first commercially viable alloy-steel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bramfitt, B. L.|title=Metallographer's Guide: Practice and Procedures for Irons and Steels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoM8VJHTt24C&pg=PA13|year=2001|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-1-61503-146-7|pages=13–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502154559/https://books.google.com/books?id=hoM8VJHTt24C&pg=PA13|archivedate=2016-05-02|df=}}</ref> Afterward, he created [[silicon steel]], launching the search for other possible alloys of steel.<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale -- Cambridge University Press 1987 Page 57—62</ref>

[[Robert Forester Mushet]] found that by adding [[tungsten]] to steel it could produce a very hard edge that would resist losing its hardness at high temperatures. "R. Mushet's special steel" (RMS) became the first [[high-speed steel]].<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale – Cambridge University Press 1987 Page 66—68</ref> In 1912, the Krupp Ironworks in Germany developed a rust-resistant steel by adding 21% [[chromium]] and 7% [[nickel]], producing the first [[stainless steel]].<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale – Cambridge University Press 1987 Page 75</ref>

===Precipitation-hardening alloys===
In 1906, [[precipitation hardening]] alloys were discovered by [[Alfred Wilm]]. Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain alloys of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], and copper, are heat-treatable alloys that soften when [[quenching|quenched]] (cooled quickly), and then harden over time. After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and [[magnesium]], Wilm discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature. Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919, [[duralumin]] was one of the first "age hardening" alloys to be used, and was soon followed by many others. Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern [[aircraft]].<ref>Jacobs, M.

{{List of metallic elements}}

A '''metal''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μέταλλον ''métallon'', "mine, quarry, metal"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Ftallon μέταλλον] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref><ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/metal?q=metal metal], on Oxford Dictionaries</ref>) is a [[material]] (an [[chemical element|element]], [[Chemical compound|compound]], or [[alloy]]) that is typically [[Hardness|hard]] when in [[solid]] state, [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], shiny, and has good [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]]. Metals are generally [[Ductility|malleable]]—that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking—as well as [[Fusible alloy|fusible]] (able to be fused or melted) and [[Ductility|ductile]] (able to be drawn out into a thin wire).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/377422/metal metal]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''</ref> Around 90 of the 118 elements in the [[periodic table]] are metals; the others are [[nonmetals]] or [[metalloid]]s, though elements near the boundaries of each category have been assigned variably to either (hence the lack of an exact count). Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.

[[Astrophysicist]]s use the term "metal" to refer collectively to all elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two, [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], and not just traditional metals. A star [[Nuclear fusion|fuses]] lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, to make heavier atoms over its lifetime. Used in that sense, the [[metallicity]] of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.<ref name="Martin">{{cite web | author=John C. Martin | title=What we learn from a star's metal content | work=New Analysis RR Lyrae Kinematics in the Solar Neighborhood | url=https://edocs.uis.edu/jmart5/www/rrlyrae/metals.htm|accessdate=September 7, 2005 }}</ref>

Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures; these are formed as [[nonmetal#Allotropes|metallic allotropes of non-metals]].

The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high-rise building and bridge [[construction]], as well as most vehicles, many [[home appliance]]s, tools, pipes, non-illuminated signs and railroad tracks.  [[Precious metal]]s were historically used as [[coin]]age.

==In the periodic table==
The elements which are considered as metals under ordinary conditions are shown in yellow on the periodic table below. The remaining elements are shown either as nonmetals or as metalloids of intermediate character.
{{periodic table (metals and nonmetals)}}

==Structure and bonding==
[[File:Close packing box.svg|thumb|hcp and fcc close-packing of spheres]]
The atoms of metallic substances are [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|typically arranged]] in one of three common [[crystal structure]]s, namely [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc), [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc), and [[hexagonal close-packed]] (hcp). In bcc, each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others.  In fcc and hcp, each atom is surrounded by twelve others, but the stacking of the layers differs.   Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature.<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.</ref>

Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons, resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement.  This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity.  While this flow of electrons occurs, the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud.  This type of bond is called a [[metallic bond]].<ref name="morty">{{cite book| author = Mortimer, Charles E.|title = Chemistry: A Conceptual Approach|location = New York:|publisher = D. Van Nostrad Company| edition = 3rd |year= 1975}}</ref>

==Properties==

===Chemical===
Metals are usually inclined to form [[cations]] through electron loss,<ref name="morty"/> reacting with oxygen in the air to form [[oxide]]s over various timescales (iron [[rust]]s over years, while [[potassium]] burns in seconds). Examples:

:4 Na + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 Na<sub>2</sub>O (sodium oxide)
:2 Ca + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 CaO (calcium oxide)
:4 Al + 3 O<sub>2</sub> → 2 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (aluminium oxide).

The [[transition metal]]s (such as [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[nickel]]) are slower to oxidize because they form a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating layer]] of oxide that protects the interior. Others, like [[palladium]], [[platinum]] and [[gold]], do not react with the atmosphere at all. Some metals form a barrier layer of [[oxide]] on their surface which cannot be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades (like [[aluminium]], magnesium, some [[steel]]s, and [[titanium]]). The [[oxide]]s of metals are generally [[Base (chemistry)|basic]], as opposed to those of [[nonmetals]], which are [[acid]]ic. Exceptions are largely oxides with very high [[oxidation state]]s such as  CrO<sub>3</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and OsO<sub>4</sub>, which have strictly acidic reactions.

[[Painting]], [[anodizing]] or [[plating]] metals are good ways to prevent their [[corrosion]]. However, a more reactive metal in the [[electrochemical series]] must be chosen for coating, especially when chipping of the coating is expected. Water and the two metals form an [[electrochemical cell]], and if the coating is less reactive than the coatee, the coating actually ''promotes'' corrosion.

===Physical===
[[File:Gallium1 640x480.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gallium]] crystals]]
Metals in general have high [[electrical conductivity]], high [[thermal conductivity]], and high [[density]].  Typically they are malleable and ductile, deforming under stress without [[cleavage (crystal)|cleaving]].<ref name="morty"/> In terms of optical properties, metals are shiny and [[lustrous]]. Sheets of metal beyond a few micrometres in thickness appear opaque, but [[gold leaf]] transmits green light.

Although most metals have higher [[density|densities]] than most [[nonmetals]],<ref name="morty"/> there is wide variation in their densities, [[lithium]] being the least dense solid element and [[osmium]] the densest. The [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth]] metals in groups I A and II A are referred to as the [[light metals]] because they have low density, low hardness, and low melting points.<ref name="morty"/>  The high density of most metals is due to the tightly packed crystal lattice of the metallic structure. The strength of metallic bonds for different metals reaches a maximum around the center of the [[transition metal]] series, as those elements have large amounts of delocalized electrons in [[Tight binding|tight binding type]] metallic bonds. However, other factors (such as [[atomic radius]], [[nuclear charge]], number of bonds [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]], overlap of orbital energies and [[crystal form]]) are involved as well.<ref name="morty"/>

===Electrical===

{{Band structure filling diagram}}

The electrical and thermal conductivities of metals originate from the fact that their outer electrons are [[Delocalized electron|delocalized]].  This situation can be visualized by seeing the atomic structure of a metal as a collection of atoms embedded in a sea of highly mobile electrons. The electrical conductivity, as well as the electrons' contribution to the heat capacity and heat conductivity of metals can be calculated from the [[free electron model]], which does not take into account the detailed structure of the ion lattice.

When considering the [[electronic band structure]] and binding energy of a metal, it is necessary to take into account the positive potential caused by the specific arrangement of the ion cores—which is periodic in [[crystal]]s. The most important consequence of the periodic potential is the formation of a small [[band gap]] at the boundary of the [[Brillouin zone]]. Mathematically, the potential of the ion cores can be treated by various models, the simplest being the [[nearly free electron model]].

===Mechanical===
Mechanical properties of metals include [[ductility]], i.e. their capacity for [[plastic deformation]]. Reversible [[deformation (engineering)|elastic deformation]] in metals can be described by [[Hooke's Law]] for restoring forces, where the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] is linearly proportional to the [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]]. Forces larger than the [[elastic limit]], or heat, may cause a permanent (irreversible) deformation of the object, known as [[plastic deformation]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. This irreversible change in atomic arrangement may occur as a result of:

*The action of an applied [[force (physics)|force]] (or [[Work (physics)|work]]). An applied force may be [[tensile strength|tensile]] (pulling) force, [[compressive strength|compressive]] (pushing) force, [[Simple shear|shear]], [[bending]] or [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] (twisting) forces.
*A change in temperature (heat). A temperature change may affect the mobility of the [[crystallographic defect|structural defects]] such as [[grain boundaries]], point vacancies, line and screw [[dislocation]]s, stacking faults and twins in both [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous solid|non-crystalline]] solids. The movement or displacement of such mobile defects is [[activation energy|thermally activated]], and thus limited by the rate of [[atomic diffusion]].

[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|Hot metal work from a [[blacksmith]].]]

[[Viscous flow]] near grain boundaries, for example, can give rise to internal [[slip (materials science)|slip]], [[creep (deformation)|creep]] and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] in metals. It can also contribute to significant changes in the microstructure like [[grain growth]] and localized densification due to the elimination of intergranular [[porosity]]. Screw [[dislocation]]s may [[slip (materials science)|slip]] in the direction of any [[lattice plane]] containing the dislocation, while the principal driving force for "dislocation climb" is the movement or [[diffusion]] of vacancies through a [[crystal lattice]].

In addition, the nondirectional nature of metallic bonding is also thought to contribute significantly to the ductility of most metallic solids. When the planes of an [[ionic bond]] slide past one another, the resultant change in location shifts ions of the same charge into close proximity, resulting in the [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]] of the crystal; such shift is not observed in [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] crystals where fracture and crystal fragmentation occurs.<ref>[http://www.engineersedge.com/material_science/ductility.htm Ductility – strength of materials]</ref>

==Alloys==
{{Main|Alloy}}

An alloy is a mixture of two or more [[chemical element|elements]] in which the main component is a metal. Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for practical use. Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics. The aim of making alloys is generally to make them less brittle, harder, resistant to corrosion, or have a more desirable color and luster. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of [[iron]] ([[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[cast iron]], [[tool steel]], [[alloy steel]]) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels, with increasing carbon levels reducing ductility and toughness. The addition of [[silicon]] will produce cast irons, while the addition of [[chromium]], [[nickel]] and [[molybdenum]] to carbon steels (more than 10%) results in stainless steels.

Other significant metallic alloys are those of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[copper]] and [[magnesium]]. Copper alloys have been known since prehistory—[[bronze]] gave the [[Bronze Age]] its name—and have many applications today, most importantly in electrical wiring. The alloys of the other three metals have been developed relatively recently; due to their chemical reactivity they require [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] extraction processes. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios; magnesium can also provide [[electromagnetic shielding]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratio is more important than material cost, such as in aerospace and some automotive applications.

Alloys specially designed for highly demanding applications, such as [[jet engine]]s, may contain more than ten elements.

===Base metal===
{{main|Base metal}}
[[File:Zn reaction with HCl.JPG|thumb|Zinc, a base metal, reacting with an acid]]
In [[chemistry]], the term ''base metal'' is used informally to refer to a metal that is easily [[oxidation|oxidized]] or [[corrosion|corroded]], and reacts easily with dilute [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) to form metal chloride and [[hydrogen]]. Examples include iron, [[nickel]], [[lead]] and zinc. Copper is considered a base metal as it is oxidized relatively easily, although it does not react with HCl. Base metal is commonly used in opposition to [[noble metal]].

In [[alchemy]], a ''base metal'' was a common and inexpensive metal, as opposed to [[precious metal]]s, mainly gold and silver. A longtime goal of the alchemists was the transmutation of base metals into precious metals.

In [[numismatics]], coins in the past derived their value primarily from the [[precious metal]] content. Most modern currencies are [[fiat currency]], allowing the coins to be made of base metal.

===Ferrous metal===
{{Main|Ferrous metallurgy}}
{{See also|Non-ferrous metals}}
The term "ferrous" is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning "containing iron". This can include pure iron, such as [[wrought iron]], or an alloy such as [[steel]]. Ferrous metals are often [[magnetism|magnetic]], but not exclusively.

===Noble metal===
{{main|Noble metal}}

''Noble metals'' are metals that are resistant to [[corrosion]] or [[oxidation]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tiv9Ba4dDI4C&pg=PA267&dq=Noble+metals+are+metals+that+are+resistant+to+corrosion+or+oxidation&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7vb2S77vUAhVE1GMKHbDoATQQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&q=Noble%20metals%20are%20metals%20that%20are%20resistant%20to%20corrosion%20or%20oxidation&f=false|title=Chemical Oxidation Applications for Industrial Wastewaters|last=Tunay|first=Olcay|last2=Kabdasli|first2=Isik|last3=Arslan-Alaton|first3=Idil|last4=Olmez-Hanci|first4=Tugba|date=2010-10-12|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=9781843393078|language=en}}</ref> unlike most [[base metal]]s. They tend to be precious metals, often due to perceived rarity. Examples include gold, platinum, silver, [[rhodium]], iridium and palladium.

===Precious metal===
[[File:GoldNuggetUSGOV.jpg|thumb|left|A gold nugget]]
{{main|Precious metal}}

A ''precious metal'' is a rare metallic [[chemical element]] of high economic value.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWMqaOTqSqcC&pg=PA203&dq=A+precious+metal+rare+metal+of+high+economic+value&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj444Tq8szUAhVC1GMKHQypBMsQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=A%20precious%20metal%20rare%20metal%20of%20high%20economic%20value&f=false|title=Earth's Natural Resources|last=Walther|first=John V.|date=2013-02-15|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449632342|language=en}}</ref>

Chemically, the precious metals are less [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] than most elements, have high [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] and high electrical conductivity. Historically, precious metals were important as [[currency]], but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial [[commodity|commodities]]. [[Gold]], [[silver]], [[platinum]] and [[palladium]] each have an [[ISO 4217]] currency code. The best-known precious metals are gold and silver. While both have industrial uses, they are better known for their uses in [[art]], [[jewelry]], and [[currency|coinage]]. Other precious metals include the [[platinum group]] metals: [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]], palladium, [[osmium]], [[iridium]], and platinum, of which platinum is the most widely traded.

The demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use, but also by their role as investments and a [[store of value]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaBmBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=The+demand+for+precious+metals+is+driven+not+only+by+their+practical+use,+but+also+by+their+role+as+investments+and+a+store+of+value&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwip8Irypc3UAhVN5mMKHRzCB08Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=The%20demand%20for%20precious%20metals%20is%20driven%20not%20only%20by%20their%20practical%20use,%20but%20also%20by%20their%20role%20as%20investments%20and%20a%20store%20of%20value&f=false|title=The Art of RF (Riba-Free) Islamic Banking and Finance: Tools and Techniques for Community-Based Banking|last=Abdul-Rahman|first=Yahia|date=2014-11-10|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118770962|language=en}}</ref> Palladium and platinum are, as of fall 2017, valued at about three quarters the price of gold. Silver is substantially less expensive than these metals, but is often traditionally considered a precious metal for its role in coinage and jewelry.

===Heavy metal===
{{Main|Heavy metal (chemical element)}}
A heavy metal is any relatively dense metal or [[metalloid]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXYT3JKBm9EC&pg=PA3&dq=%C2%A0%C2%A0A+heavy+metal+is+any+relatively+dense+metal+or+metalloid&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis9MyO88zUAhVS-GMKHdW4BpoQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0%C2%A0A%20heavy%20metal%20is%20any%20relatively%20dense%20metal%20or%20metalloid&f=false|title=Metal contamination|date=2006|publisher=Editions Quae|isbn=9782759200115|language=en}}</ref> More specific definitions have been proposed, but none have obtained widespread acceptance. Some heavy metals have niche uses, or are notably toxic; some are essential in trace amounts.

==Extraction==
{{main|Ore|Mining|Extractive metallurgy}}

Metals are often extracted from the Earth by means of mining ores that are rich sources of the requisite elements, such as [[bauxite]]. Ore is located by [[prospecting]] techniques, followed by the exploration and examination of deposits. Mineral sources are generally divided into [[Surface mining|surface mines]], which are mined by excavation using heavy equipment, and [[Underground mining (hard rock)|subsurface mines]].

Once the ore is mined, the metals must be [[Extractive metallurgy|extracted]], usually by chemical or electrolytic reduction. [[Pyrometallurgy]] uses high temperatures to convert ore into raw metals, while [[hydrometallurgy]] employs [[aqueous]] chemistry for the same purpose. The methods used depend on the metal and their contaminants.

When a metal ore is an ionic compound of that metal and a non-metal, the ore must usually be [[smelting|smelted]]—heated with a reducing agent—to extract the pure metal. Many common metals, such as iron, are smelted using [[carbon]] as a reducing agent. Some metals, such as aluminium and [[sodium]], have no commercially practical reducing agent, and are extracted using [[electrolysis]] instead.<ref name="losal">{{cite web|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/11.shtml|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory – Sodium|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/13.shtml|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory – Aluminum|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>

[[Sulfide]] ores are not reduced directly to the metal but are roasted in air to convert them to oxides.

==Recycling==
Demand for metals is closely linked to economic growth. During the 20th century, the variety of metals uses in society grew rapidly. Today, the development of major nations, such as China and India, and advances in technologies, are fuelling ever more demand. The result is that mining activities are expanding, and more and more of the world's metal stocks are above ground in use, rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in-use stock of copper. Between 1932 and 1999, copper in use in the US rose from 73g to 238g per person.<ref name="unep.org">[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx ''The Recycling Rates of Metals: A Status Report''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101194304/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |date=2016-01-01 }} 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]</ref>

Metals are inherently recyclable, so in principle, can be used over and over again, minimizing these negative environmental impacts and saving energy. For example, 95% of the energy used to make aluminium from bauxite ore is saved by using recycled material.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/22/pledges.waste ''Tread lightly: Aluminium attack''] Carolyn Fry, Guardian.co.uk, 22 February 2008.</ref> Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society<ref>[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx ''Metal Stocks in Society: Scientific Synthesis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101194304/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |date=2016-01-01 }} 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]</ref> and their recycling rates.<ref name="unep.org"/>

The report authors observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground. They warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.

==Metallurgy==
{{main|Metallurgy}}

Metallurgy is a domain of materials science that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their intermetallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys.

==Applications==
Some metals and metal alloys possess high structural strength per unit mass, making them useful materials for carrying large loads or resisting impact damage. Metal alloys can be engineered to have high resistance to shear, torque and deformation. However the same metal can also be vulnerable to fatigue damage through repeated use or from sudden stress failure when a load capacity is exceeded. The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many appliances, tools, pipes, non-illuminated signs and railroad tracks.

The two most commonly used structural metals, iron and aluminium, are also the most abundant metals in the [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]].<ref>Frank Kreith and Yogi Goswami, eds. (2004). ''The CRC Handbook of Mechanical Engineering, 2nd edition. Boca Raton. p. 12-2.</ref>

Metals are good conductors, making them valuable in electrical appliances and for carrying an electric current over a distance with little energy lost. Electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties.

The thermal conductivity of metal is useful for containers to heat materials over a flame. Metal is also used for [[heat sink]]s to protect sensitive equipment from overheating.

The high reflectivity of some metals is important in the construction of mirrors, including precision astronomical instruments. This last property can also make metallic jewelry aesthetically appealing.

Some metals have specialized uses; radioactive metals such as [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] are used in [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear power plants]] to produce energy via [[nuclear fission]]. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature and is used in switches to complete a circuit when it flows over the switch contacts. [[Shape memory alloy]] is used for applications such as pipes, fasteners and vascular [[stent]]s.

Metals can be [[dopant|doped]] with foreign molecules—organic, inorganic, biological and polymers. This doping entails the metal with new properties that are induced by the guest molecules. Applications in catalysis, medicine, electrochemical cells, corrosion and more have been developed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Avnir|first1=David|title=Molecularly doped metals|journal=Acc. Chem. Res.|date=2014|volume=47|pages=579–592|doi=10.1021/ar4001982}}</ref>

==Trade==
The [[World Bank]] reports that China was the top importer of [[ores]] and metals in 2005 followed by the United States and Japan.<ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/table4_5.pdf Structure of merchandise imports]</ref>

== History ==
The nature of metals has fascinated humans for many centuries, because these materials provided people with tools of unsurpassed properties both in war and in their preparation and processing. Pure [[gold]] and [[silver]] have been known to humans since the [[Stone Age]]. [[Lead]] and silver were fused from their ores as early as the fourth millennium&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Der Große Brockhaus]] |edition=Sixteenth, altogether newly prepared |volume=7: L-MIJ |year=1955 |publisher=Bibliographisches Institut & F. A. Brockhaus |location=[[Wiesbaden]] |language=German |page=715}}</ref>

Ancient Latin and Greek writers such as [[Theophrastus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']], or [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], did not try to classify metals. The ancient Europeans never attained the concept "metal" as a distinct elementary substance with fixed, characteristic chemical and physical properties. Following [[Empedocles]], all substances within the [[sublunary sphere]] were assumed to vary in their constituent [[classical elements]] of earth, water, air and fire. Following the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], [[Plato]] assumed that these elements could be further reduced to plane geometrical shapes (triangles and squares) bounding space and relating to the [[regular polyhedra]] in the sequence earth:cube, water:icosahedron, air:octahedron, fire:tetrahedron. However, this philosophical extension did not become as popular as the simple four elements, after it was rejected by [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle also rejected the atomic theory of [[Democritus]], since he classified the implied existence of a vacuum necessary for motion as a contradiction (a vacuum implies nonexistence, therefore cannot exist). Aristotle did, however, introduce underlying antagonistic qualities (or forces) of dry vs. wet and cold vs. heat into the composition of each of the four elements.  The word "metal" originally meant "mines" and only later gained the general meaning of products from materials obtained in mines. In the first centuries A.D. a relation between the planets and the existing metals was assumed as Gold:Sun, Silver:Moon, [[Electrum]]:Jupiter, Iron:Mars, Copper:Venus, Tin:Mercury, Lead:Saturn. After electrum was determined to be a combination of silver and gold, the relations Tin:Jupiter and Mercury:Mercury were substituted into the previous sequence.<ref>[[John Maxson Stillman]], ''The Story of Early Chemistry'' D. Appleton (1924)</ref>

Arabic and medieval [[Alchemy|alchemists]] believed that all metals, and in fact, all sublunar matter, were composed of the principle of sulfur, carrying the combustible property, and the principle of mercury, the mother of all metals and carrier of the liquidity or fusibility, and the volatility properties. These principles were not necessarily the common substances [[sulfur]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] found in most laboratories. This theory reinforced the belief that the all metals were destined to become gold in the bowels of the earth through the proper combinations of heat, digestion, time, and elimination of contaminants, all of which could be developed and hastened through the knowledge and methods of alchemy. [[Paracelsus]] added the third principle of salt, carrying the nonvolatile and incombustible properties, in his [[Paracelsus#Philosophy|''tria prima'' doctrine]]. These theories retained the four classical elements as underlying the composition of sulfur, mercury and salt.

The first systematic text on the arts of mining and metallurgy was [[De la pirotechnia|''De la Pirotechnia'']] by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]], which treats the examination, fusion, and working of metals. Sixteen years later, [[Georgius Agricola]] published ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' in 1555, a clear and complete account of the profession of mining, metallurgy, and the accessory arts and sciences, as well as qualifying as the greatest treatise on the chemical industry through the sixteenth century. He gave the following description of a metal in his ''[[De Natura Fossilium]]'' (1546).

<blockquote>
Metal is a mineral body, by nature either liquid or somewhat hard. The latter may be melted by the heat of the fire, but when it has cooled down again and lost all heat, it becomes hard again and resumes its proper form. In this respect it differs from the stone which melts in the fire, for although the latter regain its hardness, yet it loses its pristine form and properties. Traditionally there are six different kinds of metals, namely gold, silver, copper, iron, tin and lead. There are really others, for [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] is a metal, although the Alchemists disagree with us on this subject, and [[bismuth]] is also. The ancient Greek writers seem to have been ignorant of bismuth, wherefore Ammonius rightly states that there are many species of metals, animals, and plants which are unknown to us. [[Stibium]] when smelted in the crucible and refined has as much right to be regarded as a proper metal as is accorded to lead by writers. If when smelted, a certain portion be added to tin, a bookseller's alloy is produced from which the type is made that is used by those who print books on paper. Each metal has its own form which it preserves when separated from those metals which were mixed with it. Therefore neither [[electrum]] nor Stannum [not meaning our tin] is of itself a real metal, but rather an alloy of two metals. Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver, Stannum of lead and silver. And yet if silver be parted from the electrum, then gold remains and not electrum; if silver be taken away from Stannum, then lead remains and not Stannum. Whether brass, however, is found as a native metal or not, cannot be ascertained with any surety. We only know of the artificial brass, which consists of copper tinted with the colour of the mineral [[calamine]]. And yet if any should be dug up, it would be a proper metal. Black and white copper seem to be different from the red kind. Metal, therefore, is by nature either solid, as I have stated, or fluid, as in the unique case of quicksilver. But enough now concerning the simple kinds.<ref>Georgius Agricola, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38015/38015-h/38015-h.htm ''De Re Metallica''] (1556) Tr.

'''Material''' is a broad term for a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute a [[object (philosophy)|thing]].

In the metaphysical sense, materials can be anything something else is consisting of, whether pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), geological, biological, choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]


==Classification of Materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to,and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Juwhari|first1=H|title=Room Temperature Photoluminescence of Spray-Deposited ZnO Thin Films on Glass Substrates|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=July 2017|volume=42|issue=28|page=17741-17747|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Juwhari|first1=H|title=A Study on the DC-Electrical and Thermal Conductivities of Epoxy/ZnO Composites doped with Carbon Black|journal=Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids|date=June 2014|volume=169|issue=6|page=560-572|doi=10.1080/10420150.2014.905944}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Juwhari|first1=H|title=Investigation of Thermal and Electrical Properties for Conductive Polymer Composites|journal=Journal of Electronic Materials|date=October 2017|volume=46|issue=10|page=5705–5714|doi=10.1007/s11664-017-5615-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Juwhari|first1=H|title=Infrared photoluminescence of sol–gel spin-coated films of rare-earth activated lanthanum silicate|journal=Materials Letters|date=November 2012|volume=87|page=80–83|doi=10.1016/j.matlet.2012.07.095}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Juwhari|first1=H|title=Hydrothermal synthesis of Eu2+ -activated borosilicate phosphors with the danburite structure|journal=Materials Letters|date=December 2012|volume=88|page=16-18|doi=10.1016/j.matlet.2012.08.050}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Juwhari|first1=H|title=Luminescence of rare earth borosilicates with the stillwellite and related structures|journal=Materials Letters|date=August 2010|volume=64|issue=15|page=1751-1754|doi=10.1016/j.matlet.2010.04.037}}</ref>

Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from [[mixture]]s. A common example of a chemical substance is pure [[Water (molecule)|water]]; it has the same properties and the same [[ratio]] of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] whether it is isolated from a river or made in a [[laboratory]]. Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are [[diamond]] (carbon), [[gold]], [[Edible salt|table salt]] ([[sodium chloride]]) and refined [[sugar]] ([[sucrose]]). However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure, and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical.

Chemical substances exist as [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es, or [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and may change between these [[Phase (matter)|phases of matter]] with changes in [[temperature]] or [[pressure]]. Chemical substances may be combined or converted to others by means of [[chemical reaction]]s.

Forms of [[energy]], such as [[light]] and [[heat]], are not matter, and are thus not "substances" in this regard.

==Definition==
[[File:Nile red 01.jpg|thumb|Colors of a single chemical ([[Nile red]]) in different solvents, under visible and UV light, showing how the chemical interacts dynamically with its solvent environment.]]
A chemical substance may well be defined as "any [[material]] with a definite chemical composition" in an introductory general chemistry textbook.<ref name="HillPetrucciP5">Hill, J. W.; Petrucci, R. H.; McCreary, T. W.; Perry, S. S. ''General Chemistry'', 4th ed., p5, Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2005</ref> According to this definition a chemical substance can either be a pure [[chemical element]] or a pure chemical compound. But, there are exceptions to this definition; a pure substance can also be defined as a form of [[matter]] that has both definite composition and distinct properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/p/u/pure%20substance/source.html |title=Pure Substance – DiracDelta Science & Engineering Encyclopedia |publisher=Diracdelta.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181524/http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/p/u/pure%20substance/source.html |archivedate=2013-05-11 |df= }}</ref> The chemical substance index published by [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] also includes several [[alloys]] of uncertain composition.<ref>[http://www.cas.org/ASSETS/58D34DD3892142D18F5C3B0A004D3A0C/indexguideapp.pdf Appendix IV: Chemical Substance Index Names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203025138/http://www.cas.org/ASSETS/58D34DD3892142D18F5C3B0A004D3A0C/indexguideapp.pdf |date=2007-12-03 }}</ref> [[Non-stoichiometric compound]]s are a special case (in [[inorganic chemistry]]) that violates the law of constant composition, and for them, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound, as in the case of [[palladium hydride]]. Broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can be found, for example: "the term 'chemical substance' means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including – (i) any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppt/newchems/pubs/invntory.htm|title=What is the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory?|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2009-10-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605152252/http://www.epa.gov/oppt/newchems/pubs/invntory.htm|archivedate=2009-06-05|df=}}</ref>

In [[geology]], substances of uniform composition are called [[mineral]]s, while physical mixtures ([[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s) of several minerals (different substances) are defined as [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s. Many minerals, however, mutually dissolve into [[solid solution]]s, such that a single rock is a uniform substance despite being a mixture in stoichiometric terms. [[Feldspar]]s are a common example: [[anorthoclase]] is an alkali aluminum silicate, where the alkali metal is interchangeably either sodium or potassium.

In law, "chemical substances" may include both pure substances and mixtures with a defined composition or manufacturing process. For example, the [[European Union|EU]] regulation [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] defines "monoconstituent substances", "multiconstituent substances" and "substances of unknown or variable composition". The latter two consist of multiple chemical substances; however, their identity can be established either by direct chemical analysis or reference to a single manufacturing process. For example, [[charcoal]] is an extremely complex, partially polymeric mixture that can be defined by its manufacturing process. Therefore, although the exact chemical identity is unknown, identification can be made to a sufficient accuracy. The CAS index also includes mixtures.

[[Polymer]]s almost always appear as mixtures of molecules of multiple molar masses, each of which could be considered a separate chemical substance. However, the polymer may be defined by a known precursor or reaction(s) and the [[molar mass distribution]]. For example, [[polyethylene]] is a mixture of very long chains of -CH<sub>2</sub>- repeating units, and is generally sold in several molar mass distributions, [[Low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Medium-density polyethylene|MDPE]], [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] and [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]].

==History==
The [[concept]] of a "chemical substance" became firmly established in the late eighteenth century after work by the chemist [[Joseph Proust]] on the composition of some pure chemical compounds such as [[basic copper carbonate]].<ref name="Hill_et_al_p37">Hill, J. W.; Petrucci, R. H.; McCreary, T. W.; Perry, S. S. ''General Chemistry'', 4th ed., p37, Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2005.</ref> He deduced that, "All samples of a compound have the same composition; that is, all samples have the same proportions, by mass, of the elements present in the compound." This is now known as the [[law of constant composition]].<ref>[http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/AtomicStructure/LawofDefiniteProportion.html Law of Definite Proportions] {{web-archive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118150853/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/AtomicStructure/LawofDefiniteProportion.html |date=November 18, 2007 }}</ref> Later with the advancement of methods for [[chemical synthesis]] particularly in the realm of [[organic chemistry]]; the discovery of many more chemical elements and new techniques in the realm of [[analytical chemistry]] used for isolation and purification of elements and compounds from chemicals that led to the establishment of modern [[chemistry]], the concept was defined as is found in most chemistry textbooks. However, there are some controversies regarding this definition mainly because the large number of chemical substances reported in chemistry literature need to be indexed.

[[Isomerism]] caused much consternation to early researchers, since [[isomers]] have exactly the same composition, but differ in configuration (arrangement) of the atoms. For example, there was much speculation for the chemical identity of [[benzene]], until the correct structure was described by [[Friedrich August Kekulé]]. Likewise, the idea of [[stereoisomerism]] - that atoms have rigid three-dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their three-dimensional arrangement - was another crucial step in understanding the concept of distinct chemical substances. For example, [[tartaric acid]] has three distinct isomers, a pair of [[diastereomer]]s with one diastereomer forming two [[enantiomer]]s.

==Chemical elements==
[[File:Schwefel 01.jpg|thumb|Native sulfur crystals. Sulfur occurs naturally as elemental sulfur, in [[sulfide]] and [[sulfate]] minerals and in [[hydrogen sulfide]].]]
{{Main|Chemical element}}
{{See also|List of elements}}
An [[chemical element|element]] is a chemical substance made up of a particular kind of atom and hence cannot be broken down or transformed by a chemical reaction into a different element, though it can be transmuted into another element through a [[nuclear reaction]]. This is so, because all of the atoms in a sample of an element have the same number of protons, though they may be different [[isotope]]s, with differing numbers of neutrons.

As of 2012, there are 118 known elements, about 80 of which are stable – that is, they do not change by [[radioactive decay]] into other elements. Some elements can occur as more than a single chemical substance ([[allotropes]]). For instance, oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>). The majority of elements are classified as [[metal]]s. These are elements with a characteristic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] such as [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[gold]]. Metals typically conduct electricity and heat well, and they are [[Malleability|malleable]] and [[Ductility|ductile]].<ref name="Hill_et_al_pp44-45">Hill, J. W.; Petrucci, R. H.; McCreary, T. W.; Perry, S. S. ''General Chemistry'', 4th ed., pp&nbsp;45–46, Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2005.</ref> Around a dozen elements,<ref>The boundary between metalloids and non-metals is imprecise, as explained in the previous reference.</ref> such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]], are classified as [[non-metal]]s. Non-metals lack the metallic properties described above, they also have a high [[electronegativity]] and a tendency to form [[Ion|negative ions]]. Certain elements such as [[silicon]] sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non-metals, and are known as [[metalloid]]s.

==Chemical compounds==
[[File:Potassium-ferricyanide-sample.jpg|thumb|[[Potassium ferricyanide]] is a compound of potassium, iron, carbon and nitrogen; although it contains cyanide anions, it does not release them and is nontoxic.]]
{{Main|Chemical compound}}
{{See also|List of organic compounds|List of inorganic compounds}}
A pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a particular set of [[molecule]]s or [[ion]]s. Two or more elements combined into one substance through a [[chemical reaction]] form a [[chemical compound]]. All compounds are substances, but not all substances are compounds.

A chemical compound can be either atoms [[Chemical bond|bonded]] together in [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s in which atoms, molecules or ions form a [[crystal structure|crystalline lattice]]. Compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called [[organic compound]]s, and all others are called [[inorganic compound]]s. Compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal are called [[organometallic compound]]s.

Compounds in which components share electrons are known as [[covalent bond|covalent]] compounds. Compounds consisting of oppositely charged [[ion]]s are known as [[ionic bond|ionic]] compounds, or [[salt]]s.

In organic chemistry, there can be more than one chemical compound with the same composition and molecular weight. Generally, these are called [[isomer]]s. Isomers usually have substantially different chemical properties, may be isolated and do not spontaneously convert to each other. A common example is [[glucose]] vs. [[fructose]]. The former is an [[aldehyde]], the latter is a [[ketone]]. Their interconversion requires either [[Glucose isomerase|enzymatic]] or [[Lobry–de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation|acid-base catalysis]]. However, there are also [[tautomer]]s, where isomerization occurs spontaneously, such that a pure substance cannot be isolated into its tautomers. A common example is [[glucose]], which has open-chain and ring forms. One cannot manufacture pure open-chain glucose because glucose spontaneously cyclizes to the [[hemiacetal]] form.
Materials may also comprise other entities such as polymers. These may be inorganic or organic and sometimes a combination of inorganic and organic.

==Substances versus mixtures==
[[Image:Vintage cranberry glass.jpg|thumb|right|Cranberry glass, while it looks homogeneous, is a ''mixture'' consisting of glass and [[gold]] colloidal particles of ca. 40 nm diameter, which give it a red color.]]
{{Main|Mixture}}
All matter consists of various elements and chemical compounds, but these are often intimately mixed together. Mixtures contain more than one chemical substance, and they do not have a fixed composition. In principle, they can be separated into the component substances by purely [[Mechanics|mechanical]] processes. [[Butter]], [[soil]] and [[wood]] are common examples of mixtures.

Grey iron metal and yellow [[sulfur]] are both chemical elements, and they can be mixed together in any ratio to form a yellow-grey mixture. No chemical process occurs, and the material can be identified as a mixture by the fact that the sulfur and the iron can be separated by a mechanical process, such as using a [[magnet]] to attract the iron away from the sulfur.

In contrast, if iron and sulfur are heated together in a certain ratio (1 atom of iron for each atom of sulfur, or by weight, 56 [[gram]]s (1 [[mole (unit)|mol]]) of iron to 32&nbsp;grams (1&nbsp;mol) of sulfur), a chemical reaction takes place and a new substance is formed, the compound [[iron(II) sulfide]], with chemical formula FeS. The resulting compound has all the properties of a chemical substance and is not a mixture. Iron(II) sulfide has its own distinct properties such as [[melting point]] and [[solubility]], and the two elements cannot be separated using normal mechanical processes; a magnet will be unable to recover the iron, since there is no metallic iron present in the compound.

==Chemicals versus chemical substances==
While the term ''chemical substance'' is a precise technical term that is synonymous with ''chemical'' for chemists, the word ''chemical'' is used in general usage in the English speaking world to refer to both (pure) chemical substances and mixtures (often called ''compounds''),<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/compound ''compound''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030500/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/compound |date=2017-11-07 }} in Oxford Online Dictionaries</ref> and especially when produced or purified in a laboratory or an industrial process.<ref name=chemical>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chemical ''chemical''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055113/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chemical |date=2017-11-07 }} in Oxford Online Dictionaries</ref><ref name=rh/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicnas.gov.au/Industry/New_Chemicals/Does_My_Chemical_Require_Notification/What_Is_A_Chemical.asp |title=What is a chemical |publisher=Nicnas.gov.au |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616213642/http://www.nicnas.gov.au/Industry/New_Chemicals/Does_My_Chemical_Require_Notification/What_Is_A_Chemical.asp |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}</ref> In other words, the chemical substances of which fruits and vegetables, for example, are naturally composed even when growing wild are not called "chemicals" in general usage. In countries that require a list of ingredients in products, the "chemicals" listed are industrially produced "chemical substances". The word "chemical" is also often used to refer to addictive, narcotic, or mind-altering drugs.<ref name=chemical/><ref name=rh>[https://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/chemical Random House Unabridged Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107025305/https://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/chemical |date=2017-11-07 }}, 1997</ref>

Within the chemical industry, manufactured "chemicals" are chemical substances, which can be classified by production volume into bulk chemicals, [[fine chemical]]s and chemicals found in research only:
* Bulk chemicals are produced in very large quantities, usually with highly optimized continuous processes and to a relatively low price.
* Fine chemicals are produced at a high cost in small quantities for special low-volume applications such as biocides, pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals for technical applications.
* Research chemicals are produced individually for research, such as when searching for synthetic routes or screening substances for pharmaceutical activity. In effect, their price per gram is very high, although they are not sold. 
The cause of the difference in production volume is the complexity of the molecular structure of the chemical. Bulk chemicals are usually much less complex. While fine chemicals may be more complex, many of them are simple enough to be sold as "building blocks" in the synthesis of more complex molecules targeted for single use, as named above. The ''production'' of a chemical includes not only its synthesis but also its purification to eliminate by-products and impurities involved in the synthesis. The last step in production should be the analysis of batch lots of chemicals in order to identify and quantify the percentages of impurities for the buyer of the chemicals. The required purity and analysis depends on the application, but higher tolerance of impurities is usually expected in the production of bulk chemicals. Thus, the user of the chemical in the US might choose between the bulk or "technical grade" with higher amounts of impurities or a much purer "pharmaceutical grade" (labeled "USP", [[United States Pharmacopeia]]). "Chemicals" in the commercial and legal sense may also include mixtures of highly variable composition, as they are products made to a technical specification instead of particular chemical substances. For example, [[gasoline]] is not a single chemical compound or even a particular mixture: different gasolines can have very different chemical compositionsl, as "gasoline" is primarily defined through source, properties and [[octane rating]].

==Naming and indexing==
Every chemical substance has one or more [[systematic name]]s, usually named according to the [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC rules for naming]]. An alternative system is used by the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] (CAS).

Many compounds are also known by their more common, simpler names, many of which predate the systematic name. For example, the long-known [[sugar]] [[glucose]] is now systematically named 6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol. [[Secondary metabolite|Natural products]] and [[pharmaceutical]]s are also given simpler names, for example the mild pain-killer [[Naproxen]] is the more common name for the chemical compound (S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid.

[[Chemist]]s frequently refer to [[chemical compound]]s using [[chemical formula]]e or [[molecular structure]] of the compound. There has been a phenomenal growth in the number of chemical compounds being synthesized (or isolated), and then reported in the [[scientific literature]] by professional chemists around the world.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joachim Schummer |url=http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ed01/Jslit/eduquim.htm |title=Coping with the Growth of Chemical Knowledge: Challenges for Chemistry Documentation, Education, and Working Chemists |publisher=Rz.uni-karlsruhe.de |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917052259/http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ed01/Jslit/eduquim.htm |archivedate=2013-09-17 |df= }}</ref> An enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination of the known chemical elements. As of May 2011, about sixty million chemical compounds are known.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cas.org/newsevents/releases/60millionth052011.html |title=Chemical Abstracts substance count |publisher=Cas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511140120/http://cas.org/newsevents/releases/60millionth052011.html |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}</ref> The names of many of these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately. Also it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature. Several international organizations like [[IUPAC]] and CAS have initiated steps to make such tasks easier. CAS provides the abstracting services of the chemical literature, and provides a numerical identifier, known as [[CAS registry number]] to each chemical substance that has been reported in the chemical literature (such as [[chemistry journal]]s and [[patent]]s). This information is compiled as a [[database]] and is popularly known as the Chemical substances index. Other computer-friendly systems that have been developed for substance information, are: [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]] and the [[International Chemical Identifier]] or InChI.

==Isolation, purification, characterization, and identification==
Often a pure substance needs to be isolated from a [[mixture]], for example from a [[nature|natural source]] (where a sample often contains numerous chemical substances<!--HELP, I need a nice example, I think the extraction of cocaine from the coca-plant is stigmatising-->) or after a [[chemical reaction]] (which often give mixtures of chemical substances).

Typically, science considers these composite particles matter because they have both [[rest mass]] and volume. By contrast, [[massless particle]]s, such as [[photon]]s, are not considered matter, because they have neither rest mass nor volume. However, not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume, since fundamental particles such as [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s (sometimes equated with matter) are considered "point particles" with no effective size or volume. Nevertheless, quarks and leptons together make up "ordinary matter", and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter.

Matter exists in ''[[state of matter|states]]'' (or ''[[phase (matter)|phases]]''): the classical [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]]; as well as the more exotic [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, [[fermionic condensate]]s, and [[quark–gluon plasma]].<ref name=RHIC>

For much of the history of the [[natural science]]s people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called ''particulate theory of matter'', was first put forward by the Greek philosophers [[Leucippus]] (~490 BC) and [[Democritus]] (~470–380 BC).<ref>

}}</ref> Matter is itself a physical substance of which systems may be composed, while mass is not a substance but rather a quantitative '''property''' of matter and other substances or systems.  While there are different views on what should be considered matter, the mass of a substance or system is the same irrespective of any such definition of matter.  Another difference is that matter has an "opposite" called antimatter, but mass has no opposite—there is no such thing as "anti-mass" or negative mass.  Antimatter has the same (i.e. positive) mass property as its normal matter counterpart.

Different fields of science use the term matter in different, and sometimes incompatible, ways. Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass from simply a quantity of matter. As such, there is no single universally agreed scientific meaning of the word "matter". Scientifically, the term "mass" is well-defined, but "matter" can be defined in several ways. Sometimes in the field of physics "matter" is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons. However, in both [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], matter exhibits both [[wave]]-like and [[particle]]-like properties, the so-called [[wave–particle duality]].<ref name=Davies>

}}</ref>   Such '''atomic matter''' is also sometimes termed '''ordinary matter'''. As an example, [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] [[molecule]]s (DNA) are matter under this definition because they are made of atoms. This definition can extend to include charged atoms and molecules, so as to include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s (gases of ions) and [[electrolyte]]s (ionic solutions), which are not obviously included in the atoms definition. Alternatively, one can adopt the [[#Protons, neutrons and electrons definition|''protons, neutrons, and electrons'' definition]].

=== Based on protons, neutrons and electrons ===
A definition of "matter" more fine-scale than the atoms and molecules definition is: ''matter is made up of what [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s are made of'', meaning anything made of positively charged [[proton]]s, neutral [[neutron]]s, and negatively charged [[electron]]s.<ref name=DePodesta1>

At a microscopic level, the constituent "particles" of matter such as protons, neutrons, and electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality. At an even deeper level, protons and neutrons are made up of [[quark]]s and the force fields ([[gluon]]s) that bind them together, leading to the next definition.

=== Based on quarks and leptons ===
[[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|thumb|325px|Under the "quarks and leptons" definition, the elementary and composite particles made of the [[quarks]] (in purple) and [[leptons]] (in green) would be matter—while the gauge bosons (in red) would not be matter. However, interaction energy inherent to composite particles (for example, gluons involved in neutrons and protons) contribute to the mass of ordinary matter.]]

As seen in the above discussion, many early definitions of what can be called "ordinary matter" were based upon its structure or "building blocks".  On the scale of elementary particles, a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as: 
"ordinary matter is everything that is composed of [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s", or "ordinary matter is everything that is composed of any elementary fermions except antiquarks and antileptons".<ref name=Povh0>

 }}</ref> The connection between these formulations follows.

Leptons (the most famous being the [[electron]]), and quarks (of which [[baryons]], such as [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], are made) combine to form [[atoms]], which in turn form [[molecules]]. Because atoms and molecules are said to be matter, it is natural to phrase the definition as: "ordinary matter is anything that is made of the same things that atoms and molecules are made of". (However, notice that one also can make from these building blocks matter that is ''not'' atoms or molecules.) Then, because electrons are leptons, and protons, and neutrons are made of quarks, this definition in turn leads to the definition of matter as being "quarks and leptons", which are two of the four types of elementary fermions (the other two being antiquarks and antileptons, which can be considered antimatter as described later).

The quark–lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example). Such composites contain an interaction energy that holds the constituents together, and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite. As an example, to a great extent, the mass of an atom is simply the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons. However, digging deeper, the protons and neutrons are made up of quarks bound together by gluon fields (see [[Quantum chromodynamics#Dynamics|dynamics of quantum chromodynamics]]) and these gluons fields contribute significantly to the mass of hadrons.<ref name=Aitchison>

This quark-lepton definition of matter also leads to what can be described as "conservation of (net) matter" laws—discussed later below.  Alternatively, one could return to the mass-volume-space concept of matter, leading to the next definition, in which antimatter becomes included as a subclass of matter.

=== Based on elementary fermions (mass, volume, and space) ===

A common or traditional definition of matter is "anything that has [[mass]] and [[volume]] (occupies [[space]])".<ref name=Walker>{{cite book|author=S.M. Walker |author2=A. King|date=2005|title=What is Matter?|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o7EquxOl4MAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=matter|page=7|publisher=[[Lerner Publications]]|isbn=0-8225-5131-4}}</ref><ref name=Hage>{{cite book| author=J.Kenkel |author2=P.B.

The observation that matter occupies space goes back to antiquity. However, an explanation for why matter occupies space is recent, and is argued to be a result of the phenomenon described in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]],<ref name=Peacock>{{cite book|author=K.A. Peacock| date=2008|title=The Quantum Revolution: A Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ITqnf5jdE5QC&pg=PA47|page=47|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0-313-33448-X}}</ref><ref name=Kreiger>{{cite book|author=M.H.

Two particular examples where the exclusion principle clearly relates matter to the occupation of space are white dwarf stars and neutron stars, discussed further below.

Thus, matter can be defined as everything composed of elementary fermions. Although we don't encounter them in everyday life, antiquarks (such as the [[antiproton]]) and antileptons (such as the [[positron]]) are the [[antiparticle]]s of the quark and the lepton, are elementary fermions as well, and have essentially the same properties as quarks and leptons, including the applicability of the Pauli exclusion principle which can be said to prevent two particles from being in the same place at the same time (in the same state), i.e. makes each particle "take up space".  This particular definition leads to matter being defined to include anything made of these [[antimatter]] particles as well as the ordinary quark and lepton, and thus also anything made of [[meson]]s, which are unstable particles made up of a quark and an antiquark.

=== In general relativity and cosmology ===

In the context of [[theory of relativity|relativity]], mass is not an additive quantity, in the sense that one can add the rest masses of particles in a system to get the total rest mass of the system.<ref name=Penrose/> Thus, in relativity usually a more general view is that it is not the sum of [[rest mass]]es, but the [[Stress–energy tensor|energy–momentum tensor]] that quantifies the amount of matter. This tensor gives the rest mass for the entire system. "Matter" therefore is sometimes considered as anything that contributes to the energy–momentum of a system, that is, anything that is not purely gravity.<ref name=Caroll>

== Structure ==

In particle physics, fermions are particles that obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. Fermions can be elementary, like the electron—or composite, like the proton and neutron. In the [[Standard Model]], there are two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons, which are discussed next.

=== Quarks ===
{{Main article|Quark}}
Quarks are particles of [[fermion|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], implying that they are [[fermion]]s. They carry an [[electric charge]] of −{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;[[elementary charge|e]] (down-type quarks) or +{{frac|2|3}}&nbsp;e (up-type quarks). For comparison, an electron has a charge of −1&nbsp;e. They also carry [[colour charge]], which is the equivalent of the electric charge for the [[strong interaction]]. Quarks also undergo [[radioactive decay]], meaning that they are subject to the [[weak interaction]]. Quarks are massive particles, and therefore are also subject to [[gravity]].

==== Baryonic matter ====
{{main article|Baryon}}
Baryons are strongly interacting fermions, and so are subject to Fermi–Dirac statistics. Amongst the baryons are the protons and neutrons, which occur in atomic nuclei, but many other unstable baryons exist as well. The term [[baryon]] usually refers to triquarks—particles made of three quarks. Also, "exotic" baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark are known as [[pentaquark]]s, but their existence is not generally accepted.

Baryonic matter is the part of the universe that is made of baryons (including all atoms). This part of the universe does not include [[dark energy]], [[dark matter]], [[black holes]] or various forms of degenerate matter, such as compose [[white dwarf]] stars and [[neutron star]]s. Microwave light seen by [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP), suggests that only about 4.6% of that part of the universe within range of the best [[telescope]]s (that is, matter that may be visible because light could reach us from it), is made of baryonic matter. About 26.8% is dark matter, and about 68.3% is dark energy.<ref name="NASA Science Dark Matter">{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/ |title=Dark Energy Dark Matter |website=NASA Science: Astrophysics |date=5 June 2015}}</ref>

As a matter of fact, the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.<ref>{{Cite journal

Hence, at zero temperature, the fermions fill up sufficient levels to accommodate all the available fermions—and in the case of many fermions, the maximum kinetic energy (called the ''[[Fermi energy]]'') and the pressure of the gas becomes very large, and depends on the number of fermions rather than the temperature, unlike normal states of matter.

Degenerate matter includes the part of the universe that is made up of neutron stars and white dwarfs.

==== Strange matter ====
{{main article|Strange matter}}
'''Strange matter''' is a particular form of [[quark matter]], usually thought of as a ''liquid'' of [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]] [[quark]]s. It is contrasted with [[nuclear matter]], which is a liquid of [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark matter, which is a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange matter is expected to be [[color superconductor|color superconducting]]. Strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of [[neutron star]]s, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from [[femtometer]]s ([[strangelet]]s) to kilometers ([[quark star]]s).

===== Two meanings of the term "strange matter" =====

In [[particle physics]] and [[astrophysics]], the term is used in two ways, one broader and the other more specific.
# The broader meaning is just quark matter that contains three flavors of quarks: up, down, and strange. In this definition, there is a critical pressure and an associated critical density, and when nuclear matter (made of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) is compressed beyond this density, the protons and neutrons dissociate into quarks, yielding quark matter (probably strange matter).
# The narrower meaning is quark matter that is ''more stable than nuclear matter''. The idea that this could happen is the "strange matter hypothesis" of Bodmer<ref>

The nuclei that we see in the matter around us, which are droplets of nuclear matter, are actually [[metastable]], and given enough time (or the right external stimulus) would decay into droplets of strange matter, i.e. [[strangelet]]s.

=== Leptons ===
{{Main article|Lepton}}

Leptons are particles of [[fermion|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], meaning that they are [[fermion]]s. They carry an [[electric charge]] of −1&nbsp;[[elementary charge|e]] (charged leptons) or 0&nbsp;e (neutrinos). Unlike quarks, leptons do not carry [[colour charge]], meaning that they do not experience the [[strong interaction]]. Leptons also undergo radioactive decay, meaning that they are subject to the [[weak interaction]]. Leptons are massive particles, therefore are subject to gravity.

}}</ref> A phase is a form of matter that has a relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties (such as [[density]], [[specific heat]], [[refractive index]], and so forth). These phases include the three familiar ones ([[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es), as well as more exotic states of matter (such as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, [[superfluid]]s, [[supersolid]]s, [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, ...). A ''[[fluid]]'' may be a liquid, gas or plasma. There are also [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] phases of [[magnetic material]]s. As conditions change, matter may change from one phase into another. These phenomena are called [[phase transition]]s, and are studied in the field of [[thermodynamics]]. In nanomaterials, the vastly increased ratio of surface area to volume results in matter that can exhibit properties entirely different from those of bulk material, and not well described by any bulk phase (see [[nanomaterials]] for more details).

Phases are sometimes called ''states of matter'', but this term can lead to confusion with [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic states]]. For example, two gases maintained at different pressures are in different ''thermodynamic states'' (different pressures), but in the same ''phase'' (both are gases).

== Antimatter ==
{{main article|Antimatter}}
{{unsolved|physics|[[Baryon asymmetry]]. Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe? }}
In [[particle physics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], '''antimatter''' is matter that is composed of the [[antiparticle]]s of those that constitute ordinary matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each other, the two [[annihilation|annihilate]]; that is, they may both be converted into other particles with equal [[energy]] in accordance with [[Einstein]]'s equation {{nowrap|[[E=MC2|''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>]]}}. These new particles may be high-energy [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s) or other particle–antiparticle pairs. The resulting particles are endowed with an amount of kinetic energy equal to the difference between the [[rest mass]] of the products of the annihilation and the rest mass of the original particle–antiparticle pair, which is often quite large.  Depending on which definition of "matter" is adopted, antimatter can be said to be a particular subclass of matter, or the opposite of matter.

Antimatter is not found naturally on Earth, except very briefly and in vanishingly small quantities (as the result of [[radioactive decay]], [[lightning]] or [[cosmic ray]]s). This is because antimatter that came to exist on Earth outside the confines of a suitable physics laboratory would almost instantly meet the ordinary matter that Earth is made of, and be annihilated. Antiparticles and some stable antimatter (such as [[antihydrogen]]) can be made in tiny amounts, but not in enough quantity to do more than test a few of its theoretical properties.

There is considerable speculation both in [[science]] and [[science fiction]] as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter (in the sense of quarks and leptons but not antiquarks or antileptons), and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter (antiquarks and antileptons) instead. In the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called [[CP violation|CP (charge-parity) symmetry violation]], which can be obtained from the Standard Model,<ref name=CP>

== Conservation of matter ==

According to CP Symmetry, the two quantities that can define an amount of matter in the quark-lepton sense (and antimatter in an antiquark-antilepton sense), [[baryon number]] and [[lepton number]], are [[conservation law|conserved]]—or at least nearly so, considering [[CP violation]].  A [[baryon]] such as the proton or neutron has a baryon number of one, and a quark, because there are three in a baryon, is given a baryon number of 1/3.  So the net amount of matter, as measured by the number of quarks (minus the number of antiquarks, which each have a baryon number of -1/3), which is proportional to baryon number, and number of leptons (minus antileptons), which is called the lepton number, is practically impossible to change in any process.   Even in a nuclear bomb, none of the baryons (protons and neutrons of which the atomic nuclei are composed) are destroyed—there are as many baryons after as before the reaction, so none of these matter particles are actually destroyed and none are even converted to non-matter particles (like photons of light or radiation).  Instead, [[nuclear binding energy|nuclear]] (and perhaps [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy|chromodynamic) binding energy]] is released, as these baryons become bound into mid-size nuclei having less energy (and, [[Mass–energy equivalence|equivalently]], less [[mass per nucleon|mass) per nucleon]] compared to the original small (hydrogen) and large (plutonium etc.) nuclei.  Even in [[electron–positron annihilation]], there is actually no net matter being destroyed, because there was zero net matter (zero total lepton number and baryon number) to begin with before the annihilation—one lepton minus one antilepton equals zero net lepton number—and this net amount matter does not change as it simply remains zero after the annihilation.<ref>{{cite journal

==Historical development==

===Antiquity (c. 610 BC–c. 322 BC) ===
The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]] were among the first recorded speculators about the underlying nature of the visible world. [[Thales]] (c. 624 BC–c. 546 BC) regarded water as the fundamental material of the world. [[Anaximander]] (c. 610 BC–c. 546 BC) posited that the basic material was wholly characterless or limitless: the Infinite (''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''). [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (flourished 585 BC, d. 528 BC) posited that the basic stuff was ''pneuma'' or air. [[Heraclitus]] (c. 535–c. 475 BC) seems to say the basic element is fire, though perhaps he means that all is change.

}}</ref> Indeed, Aristotle's conception of matter is intrinsically linked to something being made or composed. In other words, in contrast to the early modern conception of matter as simply occupying space, matter for Aristotle is definitionally linked to process or change: matter is what underlies a change of substance. For example, a horse eats grass: the horse changes the grass into itself; the grass as such does not persist in the horse, but some aspect of it—its matter—does. The matter is not specifically described (e.g., as [[atom]]s), but consists of whatever persists in the change of substance from grass to horse. Matter in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e., as a [[Substance theory|substance]]), but exists interdependently (i.e., as a "principle") with form and only insofar as it underlies change. It can be helpful to conceive of the relationship of matter and form as very similar to that between parts and whole. For Aristotle, matter as such can only ''receive'' actuality from form; it has no activity or actuality in itself, similar to the way that parts as such only have their existence ''in'' a whole (otherwise they would be independent wholes).

===Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ===

[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) originated the modern conception of matter. He was primarily a geometer. Instead of, like Aristotle, deducing the existence of matter from the physical reality of change, Descartes arbitrarily postulated matter to be an abstract, mathematical substance that occupies space:
{{quotation|So, extension in length, breadth, and depth, constitutes the nature of bodily substance; and thought constitutes the nature of thinking substance. And everything else attributable to body presupposes extension, and is only a mode of extended|René Descartes|Principles of Philosophy<ref>
{{cite book

 |chapter=The Principles of Human Knowledge

}}</ref>}}

For Descartes, matter has only the property of extension, so its only activity aside from locomotion is to exclude other bodies:<ref>though even this property seems to be non-essential (René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' II [1644], "On the Principles of Material Things", no. 4.)</ref> this is the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]]. Descartes makes an absolute distinction between mind, which he defines as unextended, thinking substance, and matter, which he defines as unthinking, extended substance.<ref>
{{cite book
 |author=R. Descartes
 |chapter=The Principles of Human Knowledge
 |date=1644
 |title=Principles of Philosophy I
 |pages=8, 54, 63
 |publisher=
}}</ref> They are independent things. In contrast, Aristotle defines matter and the formal/forming principle as complementary ''principles'' that together compose one independent thing ([[Substance theory|substance]]). In short, Aristotle defines matter (roughly speaking) as what things are actually made of (with a ''potential'' independent existence), but Descartes elevates matter to an actual independent thing in itself.

The continuity and difference between Descartes' and Aristotle's conceptions is noteworthy. In both conceptions, matter is passive or inert. In the respective conceptions matter has different relationships to intelligence. For Aristotle, matter and intelligence (form) exist together in an interdependent relationship, whereas for Descartes, matter and intelligence (mind) are definitionally opposed, independent [[Substance theory|substances]].<ref>

Descartes' justification for restricting the inherent qualities of matter to extension is its permanence, but his real criterion is not permanence (which equally applied to color and resistance), but his desire to use geometry to explain all material properties.<ref>E.A. Burtt, ''Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company, 1954), 117–118.</ref> Like Descartes, Hobbes, Boyle, and Locke argued that the inherent properties of bodies were limited to extension, and that so-called secondary qualities, like color, were only products of human perception.<ref>J.E. McGuire and P.M. Heimann, "The Rejection of Newton's Concept of Matter in the Eighteenth Century", ''The Concept of Matter in Modern Philosophy'' ed. Ernan McMullin (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1978), 104–118 (105).</ref>

[[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) inherited Descartes' mechanical conception of matter. In the third of his "Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy", Newton lists the universal qualities of matter as "extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and inertia".<ref>Isaac Newton, ''Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy'', trans. A. Motte, revised by F. Cajori (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1934), pp. 398–400. Further analyzed by Maurice A. Finocchiaro, "Newton's Third Rule of Philosophizing: A Role for Logic in Historiography", ''Isis'' 65:1 (Mar. 1974), pp. 66–73.</ref> Similarly in ''Optics'' he conjectures that God created matter as "solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles", which were "...even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces".<ref>Isaac Newton, ''Optics'', Book III, pt. 1, query 31.</ref> The "primary" properties of matter were amenable to mathematical description, unlike "secondary" qualities such as color or taste. Like Descartes, Newton rejected the essential nature of secondary qualities.<ref>McGuire and Heimann, 104.</ref>

Newton developed Descartes' notion of matter by restoring to matter intrinsic properties in addition to extension (at least on a limited basis), such as mass. Newton's use of gravitational force, which worked "at a distance", effectively repudiated Descartes' mechanics, in which interactions happened exclusively by contact.<ref name=Chomsky/>

Though Newton's gravity would seem to be a ''power'' of bodies, Newton himself did not admit it to be an ''essential'' property of matter. Carrying the logic forward more consistently, [[Joseph Priestley]] (1733-1804) argued that corporeal properties transcend contact mechanics: chemical properties require the ''capacity'' for attraction.<ref name=Chomsky/> He argued matter has other inherent powers besides the so-called primary qualities of Descartes, et al.<ref>McGuire and Heimann, 113.</ref>

=== Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
Since Priestley's time, there has been a massive expansion in knowledge of the constituents of the material world (viz., molecules, atoms, subatomic particles), but there has been no further development in the ''definition'' of matter. Rather the question has been set aside. [[Noam Chomsky]] (born 1928) summarizes the situation that has prevailed since that time:
{{quotation|What is the concept of body that finally emerged?[...] The answer is that there is no clear and definite conception of body.[...] Rather, the material world is whatever we discover it to be, with whatever properties it must be assumed to have for the purposes of explanatory theory. Any intelligible theory that offers genuine explanations and that can be assimilated to the core notions of physics becomes part of the theory of the material world, part of our account of body. If we have such a theory in some domain, we seek to assimilate it to the core notions of physics, perhaps modifying these notions as we carry out this enterprise. |Noam Chomsky|''Language and problems of knowledge: the Managua lectures'', p. 144<ref name=Chomsky>

So matter is whatever physics studies and the object of study of physics is matter: there is no independent general definition of matter, apart from its fitting into the methodology of measurement and controlled experimentation. In sum, the boundaries between what constitutes matter and everything else remains as vague as the [[demarcation problem]] of delimiting science from everything else.<ref>Nevertheless, it remains true that the mathematization regarded as requisite for a modern physical theory carries its own implicit notion of matter, which is very like Descartes', despite the demonstrated vacuity of the latter's notions.</ref>

In the 19th century, following the development of the [[periodic table]], and of [[atomic theory]], [[atom]]s were seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter; atoms formed [[molecules]] and [[compound (chemistry)|compounds]].<ref name=Wenham>

The common definition in terms of occupying space and having mass is in contrast with most physical and chemical definitions of matter, which rely instead upon its structure and upon attributes not necessarily related to volume and mass. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the knowledge of matter began a rapid evolution.

Aspects of the Newtonian view still held sway. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discussed matter in his work ''Matter and Motion''.<ref name=Maxwell>

Rather than simply having the attributes of mass and occupying space, matter was held to have chemical and electrical properties. In 1909 the famous physicist [[J. J.

In the late 19th century with the [[Thomson experiment|discovery]] of the [[electron]], and in the early 20th century, with the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment|discovery]] of the [[atomic nucleus]], and the birth of [[particle physics]], matter was seen as made up of electrons, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s interacting to form atoms. Today, we know that even protons and neutrons are not indivisible, they can be divided into [[quark]]s, while electrons are part of a particle family called [[lepton]]s. Both [[#Quarks and leptons definition|quarks and leptons]] are [[elementary particle]]s, and are currently seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter.<ref name=Povh1>
The history of the concept of matter is a history of the fundamental ''length scales'' used to define matter. Different building blocks apply depending upon whether one defines matter on an atomic or elementary particle level. One may use a definition that matter is atoms, or that matter is [[hadron]]s, or that matter is leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.

==Summary==
The modern conception of matter has been refined many times in history, in light of the improvement in knowledge of just ''what'' the basic building blocks are, and in how they interact.
The term "matter" is used throughout physics in a bewildering variety of contexts: for example, one refers to "[[condensed matter physics]]",<ref name=Chaikin>

[[File:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|350px|The four major domains of modern physics]]

'''Classical physics''' refers to theories of [[physics]] that predate modern, more complete, or more widely applicable theories. If a currently accepted theory is considered to be "modern," and its introduction represented a major [[paradigm shift]], then the previous theories, or new theories based on the older paradigm, will often be referred to as belonging to the realm of "classical" physics.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

As such, the definition of a classical theory depends on context. Classical physical concepts are often used when modern theories are unnecessarily complex for a particular situation. Most usually ''Classical Physics'' refers  to  pre-1900,  while  ''Modern Physics'' refers to post-1900 to include quantum mechanics and relativity.<ref>Weidner and Sells, ''Elementary Modern Physics'' Preface p.iii, 1968</ref>

==Overview==
{{Classical mechanics}}
Classical theory has at least two distinct meanings in physics. In the context of [[quantum mechanics]], classical theory refers to [[theory|theories]] of physics that do not use the [[Quantization (physics)|quantisation]] [[paradigm]], which includes [[classical mechanics]] and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Morin |first=David |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780521876223}}</ref> Likewise, [[classical field theories]], such as [[general relativity]] and [[classical electromagnetism]], are those that do not use quantum mechanics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barut |first=Asim O. |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics |year=1980| origyear=1964 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |location=New York |isbn= 9780486640389}}</ref> In the context of general and special relativity, classical theories are those that obey [[principle of relativity|Galilean relativity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einstein|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Einstein|translator= Robert W. Lawson |title=Relativity|year=2004|origyear=1920|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=9780760759219}}</ref>

Depending on point of view, among the branches of theory sometimes included in classical physics are variably:

* [[Classical mechanics]]
** [[Newton's laws of motion]]
** Classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalisms
* [[Classical electrodynamics]] ([[Maxwell's Equations]])
* Classical [[thermodynamics]]
* [[Special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]
* Classical [[chaos theory]] and [[nonlinear dynamics]]

==Comparison with modern physics==
In contrast to classical physics, "[[modern physics]]" is a slightly looser term which may refer to just [[quantum physics]] or to [[History of physics#20th century|20th and 21st century physics]] in general.  Modern physics includes [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]], when applicable.

A physical system can be described by classical physics when it satisfies conditions such that the laws of classical physics are approximately valid. In practice, physical objects ranging from those larger than [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, to objects in the macroscopic and astronomical realm, can be well-described (understood) with [[classical mechanics]]. Beginning at the atomic level and lower, the laws of classical physics break down and generally do not provide a correct description of nature. Electromagnetic fields and forces can be described well by classical electrodynamics at length scales and field strengths large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible. Unlike quantum physics, classical physics is generally characterized by the principle of complete [[Scientific determinism|determinism]], although deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics do exist.

From the point of view of classical physics as being non-relativistic physics, the predictions of general and special relativity are significantly different than those of classical theories, particularly concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Traditionally, light was reconciled with classical mechanics by assuming the existence of a stationary medium through which light propagated, the [[luminiferous aether]], which was later shown not to exist.

Mathematically, classical physics equations are those in which [[Planck's constant]] does not appear. According to the [[correspondence principle]] and [[Ehrenfest's theorem]], as a system becomes larger or more massive the classical dynamics tends to emerge, with some exceptions, such as [[superfluidity]]. This is why we can usually ignore quantum mechanics when dealing with everyday objects and the classical description will suffice. However, one of the most vigorous on-going fields of research in physics is [[Decoherence#Loss of interference and the transition from quantum to classical|classical-quantum correspondence]]. This field of research is concerned with the discovery of how the laws of quantum physics give rise to classical physics found at the limit of the large scales of the classical level.

==Computer modeling and manual calculation, modern and classic comparison== 
[[File:The two physic theories without refutation at the moment.jpg|thumb|350px|A computer model would use quantum theory and relativistic theory only]] 
Today a computer performs millions of arithmetic operations in seconds to solve a classical [[differential equation]], while Newton (one of the fathers of the differential calculus) would take hours to solve the same equation by manual calculation, even if he were the discoverer of that particular equation.

Computer modeling is essential for quantum and relativistic physics. Classic physics is considered the limit of quantum mechanics for large number of particles. On the other hand, [[classic mechanics]] is derived from [[relativistic mechanics]]. For example, in many formulations from special relativity, a correction factor (v/c)<sup>2</sup> appears, where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light. For velocities much smaller than that of light, one can neglect the terms with c<sup>2</sup> and higher that appear. These formulas then reduce to the standard definitions of Newtonian kinetic energy and momentum. This is as it should be, for special relativity must agree with Newtonian mechanics at low velocities. Computer modeling has to be as real as possible.  Classical physics would introduce an error as in the [[superfluidity]] case. In order to produce reliable models of the world, we can not use classic physics.  It is true that quantum theories consume time and computer resources, and the equations of classical physics could be resorted to provide a quick solution, but such a solution would lack reliability.

Computer modeling would use only the energy criteria to determine which theory to use: relativity or quantum theory, when attempting to describe the behavior of an object. A physicist would use a classical model to provide an approximation before more exacting models are applied and those calculations proceed.

In a computer model, there is no need to use the speed of the object if classical physics is excluded.  Low energy objects would be handled by quantum theory and high energy objects by relativity theory.<ref name="zurek03">Wojciech H.

}}

'''Natural science''' is a branch of [[science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[space science]], [[chemistry]], and [[Earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.<ref>Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}.</ref> Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.<ref name="Wordnet definition">{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}</ref>

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

==Branches of natural science==
{{Outline|Outline of natural science}}

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:DNA-fragment-3D-vdW.png|thumb|upright|A fragment of [[DNA]], the chemical sequence that contains instructions for [[life]]]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

====Astronomy====
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric science====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric science]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Islam]] in the [[Middle East]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Arab scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.<ref name=Holmes>{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}</ref> But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}</ref> the natural sciences contain three great branches:

<blockquote>Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}</ref></blockquote>

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.
