{{List of metallic elements}}

A '''metal''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μέταλλον ''métallon'', "mine, quarry, metal"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Ftallon μέταλλον] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref><ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/metal?q=metal metal], on Oxford Dictionaries</ref>) is a [[material]] (an [[chemical element|element]], [[Chemical compound|compound]], or [[alloy]]) that is typically [[Hardness|hard]] when in [[solid]] state, [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], shiny, and has good [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]]. Metals are generally [[Ductility|malleable]]—that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking—as well as [[Fusible alloy|fusible]] (able to be fused or melted) and [[Ductility|ductile]] (able to be drawn out into a thin wire).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/377422/metal metal]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''</ref> Around 90 of the 118 elements in the [[periodic table]] are metals; the others are [[nonmetals]] or [[metalloid]]s, though elements near the boundaries of each category have been assigned variably to either (hence the lack of an exact count). Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.

[[Astrophysicist]]s use the term "metal" to refer collectively to all elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two, [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], and not just traditional metals. A star [[Nuclear fusion|fuses]] lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, to make heavier atoms over its lifetime. Used in that sense, the [[metallicity]] of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.<ref name="Martin">{{cite web | author=John C. Martin | title=What we learn from a star's metal content | work=New Analysis RR Lyrae Kinematics in the Solar Neighborhood | url=https://edocs.uis.edu/jmart5/www/rrlyrae/metals.htm|accessdate=September 7, 2005 }}</ref>

Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures; these are formed as [[nonmetal#Allotropes|metallic allotropes of non-metals]].

The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high-rise building and bridge [[construction]], as well as most vehicles, many [[home appliance]]s, tools, pipes, non-illuminated signs and railroad tracks.  [[Precious metal]]s were historically used as [[coin]]age.

==In the periodic table==
The elements which are considered as metals under ordinary conditions are shown in yellow on the periodic table below. The remaining elements are shown either as nonmetals or as metalloids of intermediate character.
{{periodic table (metals and nonmetals)}}

==Structure and bonding==
[[File:Close packing box.svg|thumb|hcp and fcc close-packing of spheres]]
The atoms of metallic substances are [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|typically arranged]] in one of three common [[crystal structure]]s, namely [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc), [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc), and [[hexagonal close-packed]] (hcp). In bcc, each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others.  In fcc and hcp, each atom is surrounded by twelve others, but the stacking of the layers differs.   Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature.<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.</ref>

Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons, resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement.  This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity.  While this flow of electrons occurs, the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud.  This type of bond is called a [[metallic bond]].<ref name="morty">{{cite book| author = Mortimer, Charles E.|title = Chemistry: A Conceptual Approach|location = New York:|publisher = D. Van Nostrad Company| edition = 3rd |year= 1975}}</ref>

==Properties==

===Chemical===
Metals are usually inclined to form [[cations]] through electron loss,<ref name="morty"/> reacting with oxygen in the air to form [[oxide]]s over various timescales (iron [[rust]]s over years, while [[potassium]] burns in seconds). Examples:

:4 Na + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 Na<sub>2</sub>O (sodium oxide)
:2 Ca + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 CaO (calcium oxide)
:4 Al + 3 O<sub>2</sub> → 2 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (aluminium oxide).

The [[transition metal]]s (such as [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[nickel]]) are slower to oxidize because they form a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating layer]] of oxide that protects the interior. Others, like [[palladium]], [[platinum]] and [[gold]], do not react with the atmosphere at all. Some metals form a barrier layer of [[oxide]] on their surface which cannot be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades (like [[aluminium]], magnesium, some [[steel]]s, and [[titanium]]). The [[oxide]]s of metals are generally [[Base (chemistry)|basic]], as opposed to those of [[nonmetals]], which are [[acid]]ic. Exceptions are largely oxides with very high [[oxidation state]]s such as  CrO<sub>3</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and OsO<sub>4</sub>, which have strictly acidic reactions.

[[Painting]], [[anodizing]] or [[plating]] metals are good ways to prevent their [[corrosion]]. However, a more reactive metal in the [[electrochemical series]] must be chosen for coating, especially when chipping of the coating is expected. Water and the two metals form an [[electrochemical cell]], and if the coating is less reactive than the coatee, the coating actually ''promotes'' corrosion.

===Physical===
[[File:Gallium1 640x480.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gallium]] crystals]]
Metals in general have high [[electrical conductivity]], high [[thermal conductivity]], and high [[density]].  Typically they are malleable and ductile, deforming under stress without [[cleavage (crystal)|cleaving]].<ref name="morty"/> In terms of optical properties, metals are shiny and [[lustrous]]. Sheets of metal beyond a few micrometres in thickness appear opaque, but [[gold leaf]] transmits green light.

Although most metals have higher [[density|densities]] than most [[nonmetals]],<ref name="morty"/> there is wide variation in their densities, [[lithium]] being the least dense solid element and [[osmium]] the densest. The [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth]] metals in groups I A and II A are referred to as the [[light metals]] because they have low density, low hardness, and low melting points.<ref name="morty"/>  The high density of most metals is due to the tightly packed crystal lattice of the metallic structure. The strength of metallic bonds for different metals reaches a maximum around the center of the [[transition metal]] series, as those elements have large amounts of delocalized electrons in [[Tight binding|tight binding type]] metallic bonds. However, other factors (such as [[atomic radius]], [[nuclear charge]], number of bonds [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]], overlap of orbital energies and [[crystal form]]) are involved as well.<ref name="morty"/>

===Electrical===

{{Band structure filling diagram}}

The electrical and thermal conductivities of metals originate from the fact that their outer electrons are [[Delocalized electron|delocalized]].  This situation can be visualized by seeing the atomic structure of a metal as a collection of atoms embedded in a sea of highly mobile electrons. The electrical conductivity, as well as the electrons' contribution to the heat capacity and heat conductivity of metals can be calculated from the [[free electron model]], which does not take into account the detailed structure of the ion lattice.

When considering the [[electronic band structure]] and binding energy of a metal, it is necessary to take into account the positive potential caused by the specific arrangement of the ion cores—which is periodic in [[crystal]]s. The most important consequence of the periodic potential is the formation of a small [[band gap]] at the boundary of the [[Brillouin zone]]. Mathematically, the potential of the ion cores can be treated by various models, the simplest being the [[nearly free electron model]].

===Mechanical===
Mechanical properties of metals include [[ductility]], i.e. their capacity for [[plastic deformation]]. Reversible [[deformation (engineering)|elastic deformation]] in metals can be described by [[Hooke's Law]] for restoring forces, where the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] is linearly proportional to the [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]]. Forces larger than the [[elastic limit]], or heat, may cause a permanent (irreversible) deformation of the object, known as [[plastic deformation]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. This irreversible change in atomic arrangement may occur as a result of:

*The action of an applied [[force (physics)|force]] (or [[Work (physics)|work]]). An applied force may be [[tensile strength|tensile]] (pulling) force, [[compressive strength|compressive]] (pushing) force, [[Simple shear|shear]], [[bending]] or [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] (twisting) forces.
*A change in temperature (heat). A temperature change may affect the mobility of the [[crystallographic defect|structural defects]] such as [[grain boundaries]], point vacancies, line and screw [[dislocation]]s, stacking faults and twins in both [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous solid|non-crystalline]] solids. The movement or displacement of such mobile defects is [[activation energy|thermally activated]], and thus limited by the rate of [[atomic diffusion]].

[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|Hot metal work from a [[blacksmith]].]]

[[Viscous flow]] near grain boundaries, for example, can give rise to internal [[slip (materials science)|slip]], [[creep (deformation)|creep]] and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] in metals. It can also contribute to significant changes in the microstructure like [[grain growth]] and localized densification due to the elimination of intergranular [[porosity]]. Screw [[dislocation]]s may [[slip (materials science)|slip]] in the direction of any [[lattice plane]] containing the dislocation, while the principal driving force for "dislocation climb" is the movement or [[diffusion]] of vacancies through a [[crystal lattice]].

In addition, the nondirectional nature of metallic bonding is also thought to contribute significantly to the ductility of most metallic solids. When the planes of an [[ionic bond]] slide past one another, the resultant change in location shifts ions of the same charge into close proximity, resulting in the [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]] of the crystal; such shift is not observed in [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] crystals where fracture and crystal fragmentation occurs.<ref>[http://www.engineersedge.com/material_science/ductility.htm Ductility – strength of materials]</ref>

==Alloys==
{{Main|Alloy}}

An alloy is a mixture of two or more [[chemical element|elements]] in which the main component is a metal. Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for practical use. Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics. The aim of making alloys is generally to make them less brittle, harder, resistant to corrosion, or have a more desirable color and luster. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of [[iron]] ([[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[cast iron]], [[tool steel]], [[alloy steel]]) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels, with increasing carbon levels reducing ductility and toughness. The addition of [[silicon]] will produce cast irons, while the addition of [[chromium]], [[nickel]] and [[molybdenum]] to carbon steels (more than 10%) results in stainless steels.

Other significant metallic alloys are those of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[copper]] and [[magnesium]]. Copper alloys have been known since prehistory—[[bronze]] gave the [[Bronze Age]] its name—and have many applications today, most importantly in electrical wiring. The alloys of the other three metals have been developed relatively recently; due to their chemical reactivity they require [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] extraction processes. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios; magnesium can also provide [[electromagnetic shielding]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratio is more important than material cost, such as in aerospace and some automotive applications.

Alloys specially designed for highly demanding applications, such as [[jet engine]]s, may contain more than ten elements.

===Base metal===
{{main|Base metal}}
[[File:Zn reaction with HCl.JPG|thumb|Zinc, a base metal, reacting with an acid]]
In [[chemistry]], the term ''base metal'' is used informally to refer to a metal that is easily [[oxidation|oxidized]] or [[corrosion|corroded]], and reacts easily with dilute [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) to form metal chloride and [[hydrogen]]. Examples include iron, [[nickel]], [[lead]] and zinc. Copper is considered a base metal as it is oxidized relatively easily, although it does not react with HCl. Base metal is commonly used in opposition to [[noble metal]].

In [[alchemy]], a ''base metal'' was a common and inexpensive metal, as opposed to [[precious metal]]s, mainly gold and silver. A longtime goal of the alchemists was the transmutation of base metals into precious metals.

In [[numismatics]], coins in the past derived their value primarily from the [[precious metal]] content. Most modern currencies are [[fiat currency]], allowing the coins to be made of base metal.

===Ferrous metal===
{{Main|Ferrous metallurgy}}
{{See also|Non-ferrous metals}}
The term "ferrous" is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning "containing iron". This can include pure iron, such as [[wrought iron]], or an alloy such as [[steel]]. Ferrous metals are often [[magnetism|magnetic]], but not exclusively.

===Noble metal===
{{main|Noble metal}}

''Noble metals'' are metals that are resistant to [[corrosion]] or [[oxidation]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tiv9Ba4dDI4C&pg=PA267&dq=Noble+metals+are+metals+that+are+resistant+to+corrosion+or+oxidation&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7vb2S77vUAhVE1GMKHbDoATQQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&q=Noble%20metals%20are%20metals%20that%20are%20resistant%20to%20corrosion%20or%20oxidation&f=false|title=Chemical Oxidation Applications for Industrial Wastewaters|last=Tunay|first=Olcay|last2=Kabdasli|first2=Isik|last3=Arslan-Alaton|first3=Idil|last4=Olmez-Hanci|first4=Tugba|date=2010-10-12|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=9781843393078|language=en}}</ref> unlike most [[base metal]]s. They tend to be precious metals, often due to perceived rarity. Examples include gold, platinum, silver, [[rhodium]], iridium and palladium.

===Precious metal===
[[File:GoldNuggetUSGOV.jpg|thumb|left|A gold nugget]]
{{main|Precious metal}}

A ''precious metal'' is a rare metallic [[chemical element]] of high economic value.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWMqaOTqSqcC&pg=PA203&dq=A+precious+metal+rare+metal+of+high+economic+value&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj444Tq8szUAhVC1GMKHQypBMsQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=A%20precious%20metal%20rare%20metal%20of%20high%20economic%20value&f=false|title=Earth's Natural Resources|last=Walther|first=John V.|date=2013-02-15|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449632342|language=en}}</ref>

Chemically, the precious metals are less [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] than most elements, have high [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] and high electrical conductivity. Historically, precious metals were important as [[currency]], but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial [[commodity|commodities]]. [[Gold]], [[silver]], [[platinum]] and [[palladium]] each have an [[ISO 4217]] currency code. The best-known precious metals are gold and silver. While both have industrial uses, they are better known for their uses in [[art]], [[jewelry]], and [[currency|coinage]]. Other precious metals include the [[platinum group]] metals: [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]], palladium, [[osmium]], [[iridium]], and platinum, of which platinum is the most widely traded.

The demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use, but also by their role as investments and a [[store of value]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaBmBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=The+demand+for+precious+metals+is+driven+not+only+by+their+practical+use,+but+also+by+their+role+as+investments+and+a+store+of+value&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwip8Irypc3UAhVN5mMKHRzCB08Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=The%20demand%20for%20precious%20metals%20is%20driven%20not%20only%20by%20their%20practical%20use,%20but%20also%20by%20their%20role%20as%20investments%20and%20a%20store%20of%20value&f=false|title=The Art of RF (Riba-Free) Islamic Banking and Finance: Tools and Techniques for Community-Based Banking|last=Abdul-Rahman|first=Yahia|date=2014-11-10|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118770962|language=en}}</ref> Palladium and platinum are, as of fall 2017, valued at about three quarters the price of gold. Silver is substantially less expensive than these metals, but is often traditionally considered a precious metal for its role in coinage and jewelry.

===Heavy metal===
{{Main|Heavy metal (chemical element)}}
A heavy metal is any relatively dense metal or [[metalloid]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXYT3JKBm9EC&pg=PA3&dq=%C2%A0%C2%A0A+heavy+metal+is+any+relatively+dense+metal+or+metalloid&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis9MyO88zUAhVS-GMKHdW4BpoQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0%C2%A0A%20heavy%20metal%20is%20any%20relatively%20dense%20metal%20or%20metalloid&f=false|title=Metal contamination|date=2006|publisher=Editions Quae|isbn=9782759200115|language=en}}</ref> More specific definitions have been proposed, but none have obtained widespread acceptance. Some heavy metals have niche uses, or are notably toxic; some are essential in trace amounts.

==Extraction==
{{main|Ore|Mining|Extractive metallurgy}}

Metals are often extracted from the Earth by means of mining ores that are rich sources of the requisite elements, such as [[bauxite]]. Ore is located by [[prospecting]] techniques, followed by the exploration and examination of deposits. Mineral sources are generally divided into [[Surface mining|surface mines]], which are mined by excavation using heavy equipment, and [[Underground mining (hard rock)|subsurface mines]].

Once the ore is mined, the metals must be [[Extractive metallurgy|extracted]], usually by chemical or electrolytic reduction. [[Pyrometallurgy]] uses high temperatures to convert ore into raw metals, while [[hydrometallurgy]] employs [[aqueous]] chemistry for the same purpose. The methods used depend on the metal and their contaminants.

When a metal ore is an ionic compound of that metal and a non-metal, the ore must usually be [[smelting|smelted]]—heated with a reducing agent—to extract the pure metal. Many common metals, such as iron, are smelted using [[carbon]] as a reducing agent. Some metals, such as aluminium and [[sodium]], have no commercially practical reducing agent, and are extracted using [[electrolysis]] instead.<ref name="losal">{{cite web|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/11.shtml|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory – Sodium|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/13.shtml|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory – Aluminum|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>

[[Sulfide]] ores are not reduced directly to the metal but are roasted in air to convert them to oxides.

==Recycling==
Demand for metals is closely linked to economic growth. During the 20th century, the variety of metals uses in society grew rapidly. Today, the development of major nations, such as China and India, and advances in technologies, are fuelling ever more demand. The result is that mining activities are expanding, and more and more of the world's metal stocks are above ground in use, rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in-use stock of copper. Between 1932 and 1999, copper in use in the US rose from 73g to 238g per person.<ref name="unep.org">[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx ''The Recycling Rates of Metals: A Status Report''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101194304/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |date=2016-01-01 }} 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]</ref>

Metals are inherently recyclable, so in principle, can be used over and over again, minimizing these negative environmental impacts and saving energy. For example, 95% of the energy used to make aluminium from bauxite ore is saved by using recycled material.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/22/pledges.waste ''Tread lightly: Aluminium attack''] Carolyn Fry, Guardian.co.uk, 22 February 2008.</ref> Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society<ref>[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx ''Metal Stocks in Society: Scientific Synthesis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101194304/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |date=2016-01-01 }} 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]</ref> and their recycling rates.<ref name="unep.org"/>

The report authors observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground. They warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.

==Metallurgy==
{{main|Metallurgy}}

Metallurgy is a domain of materials science that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their intermetallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys.

==Applications==
Some metals and metal alloys possess high structural strength per unit mass, making them useful materials for carrying large loads or resisting impact damage. Metal alloys can be engineered to have high resistance to shear, torque and deformation. However the same metal can also be vulnerable to fatigue damage through repeated use or from sudden stress failure when a load capacity is exceeded. The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many appliances, tools, pipes, non-illuminated signs and railroad tracks.

The two most commonly used structural metals, iron and aluminium, are also the most abundant metals in the [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]].<ref>Frank Kreith and Yogi Goswami, eds. (2004). ''The CRC Handbook of Mechanical Engineering, 2nd edition. Boca Raton. p. 12-2.</ref>

Metals are good conductors, making them valuable in electrical appliances and for carrying an electric current over a distance with little energy lost. Electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties.

The thermal conductivity of metal is useful for containers to heat materials over a flame. Metal is also used for [[heat sink]]s to protect sensitive equipment from overheating.

The high reflectivity of some metals is important in the construction of mirrors, including precision astronomical instruments. This last property can also make metallic jewelry aesthetically appealing.

Some metals have specialized uses; radioactive metals such as [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] are used in [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear power plants]] to produce energy via [[nuclear fission]]. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature and is used in switches to complete a circuit when it flows over the switch contacts. [[Shape memory alloy]] is used for applications such as pipes, fasteners and vascular [[stent]]s.

Metals can be [[dopant|doped]] with foreign molecules—organic, inorganic, biological and polymers. This doping entails the metal with new properties that are induced by the guest molecules. Applications in catalysis, medicine, electrochemical cells, corrosion and more have been developed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Avnir|first1=David|title=Molecularly doped metals|journal=Acc. Chem. Res.|date=2014|volume=47|pages=579–592|doi=10.1021/ar4001982}}</ref>

==Trade==
The [[World Bank]] reports that China was the top importer of [[ores]] and metals in 2005 followed by the United States and Japan.<ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/table4_5.pdf Structure of merchandise imports]</ref>

== History ==
The nature of metals has fascinated humans for many centuries, because these materials provided people with tools of unsurpassed properties both in war and in their preparation and processing. Pure [[gold]] and [[silver]] have been known to humans since the [[Stone Age]]. [[Lead]] and silver were fused from their ores as early as the fourth millennium&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Der Große Brockhaus]] |edition=Sixteenth, altogether newly prepared |volume=7: L-MIJ |year=1955 |publisher=Bibliographisches Institut & F. A. Brockhaus |location=[[Wiesbaden]] |language=German |page=715}}</ref>

Ancient Latin and Greek writers such as [[Theophrastus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']], or [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], did not try to classify metals. The ancient Europeans never attained the concept "metal" as a distinct elementary substance with fixed, characteristic chemical and physical properties. Following [[Empedocles]], all substances within the [[sublunary sphere]] were assumed to vary in their constituent [[classical elements]] of earth, water, air and fire. Following the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], [[Plato]] assumed that these elements could be further reduced to plane geometrical shapes (triangles and squares) bounding space and relating to the [[regular polyhedra]] in the sequence earth:cube, water:icosahedron, air:octahedron, fire:tetrahedron. However, this philosophical extension did not become as popular as the simple four elements, after it was rejected by [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle also rejected the atomic theory of [[Democritus]], since he classified the implied existence of a vacuum necessary for motion as a contradiction (a vacuum implies nonexistence, therefore cannot exist). Aristotle did, however, introduce underlying antagonistic qualities (or forces) of dry vs. wet and cold vs. heat into the composition of each of the four elements.  The word "metal" originally meant "mines" and only later gained the general meaning of products from materials obtained in mines. In the first centuries A.D. a relation between the planets and the existing metals was assumed as Gold:Sun, Silver:Moon, [[Electrum]]:Jupiter, Iron:Mars, Copper:Venus, Tin:Mercury, Lead:Saturn. After electrum was determined to be a combination of silver and gold, the relations Tin:Jupiter and Mercury:Mercury were substituted into the previous sequence.<ref>[[John Maxson Stillman]], ''The Story of Early Chemistry'' D. Appleton (1924)</ref>

Arabic and medieval [[Alchemy|alchemists]] believed that all metals, and in fact, all sublunar matter, were composed of the principle of sulfur, carrying the combustible property, and the principle of mercury, the mother of all metals and carrier of the liquidity or fusibility, and the volatility properties. These principles were not necessarily the common substances [[sulfur]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] found in most laboratories. This theory reinforced the belief that the all metals were destined to become gold in the bowels of the earth through the proper combinations of heat, digestion, time, and elimination of contaminants, all of which could be developed and hastened through the knowledge and methods of alchemy. [[Paracelsus]] added the third principle of salt, carrying the nonvolatile and incombustible properties, in his [[Paracelsus#Philosophy|''tria prima'' doctrine]]. These theories retained the four classical elements as underlying the composition of sulfur, mercury and salt.

The first systematic text on the arts of mining and metallurgy was [[De la pirotechnia|''De la Pirotechnia'']] by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]], which treats the examination, fusion, and working of metals. Sixteen years later, [[Georgius Agricola]] published ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' in 1555, a clear and complete account of the profession of mining, metallurgy, and the accessory arts and sciences, as well as qualifying as the greatest treatise on the chemical industry through the sixteenth century. He gave the following description of a metal in his ''[[De Natura Fossilium]]'' (1546).

<blockquote>
Metal is a mineral body, by nature either liquid or somewhat hard. The latter may be melted by the heat of the fire, but when it has cooled down again and lost all heat, it becomes hard again and resumes its proper form. In this respect it differs from the stone which melts in the fire, for although the latter regain its hardness, yet it loses its pristine form and properties. Traditionally there are six different kinds of metals, namely gold, silver, copper, iron, tin and lead. There are really others, for [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] is a metal, although the Alchemists disagree with us on this subject, and [[bismuth]] is also. The ancient Greek writers seem to have been ignorant of bismuth, wherefore Ammonius rightly states that there are many species of metals, animals, and plants which are unknown to us. [[Stibium]] when smelted in the crucible and refined has as much right to be regarded as a proper metal as is accorded to lead by writers. If when smelted, a certain portion be added to tin, a bookseller's alloy is produced from which the type is made that is used by those who print books on paper. Each metal has its own form which it preserves when separated from those metals which were mixed with it. Therefore neither [[electrum]] nor Stannum [not meaning our tin] is of itself a real metal, but rather an alloy of two metals. Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver, Stannum of lead and silver. And yet if silver be parted from the electrum, then gold remains and not electrum; if silver be taken away from Stannum, then lead remains and not Stannum. Whether brass, however, is found as a native metal or not, cannot be ascertained with any surety. We only know of the artificial brass, which consists of copper tinted with the colour of the mineral [[calamine]]. And yet if any should be dug up, it would be a proper metal. Black and white copper seem to be different from the red kind. Metal, therefore, is by nature either solid, as I have stated, or fluid, as in the unique case of quicksilver. But enough now concerning the simple kinds.<ref>Georgius Agricola, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38015/38015-h/38015-h.htm ''De Re Metallica''] (1556) Tr.
